7,Here Comes The Sun - Remastered 2009,The Beatles,6dGnYIeXmHdcikdzNNDMm2,see back then the goal was musical buzz what youre saying youre above battle rap no you dumb motherfuckers i never said that i just had to pursue what i love if thats something you view as a snub thats a you problem these rounds diz you really got a jew problem megaton better come with a new nuke on em throat sores so im goin michael jordan with the flu on em am i better than this no but im better than you not as a battler listen ima say this not necessarily not as a battler but as a person thats what the evidence proves when i present it to you you might pretend its a ruse and i intend to confuse you know what they say about those treacherous jews i have a question for you saw you vs iron shits brilliant but now that this jew got next tell me how many jew jokes have you got left hold on let me guess six million but let me get back to reflectin and building on all that it happened since i left the field like i was dr manhattan i was living off of my rapping till i tied the knot then i got into a tighter spot then i had to find a job but wait sorry fuck so diz a job is a place where you go to make money like an office or store you ever seen the office before its like that but less funny and then you get a check you can spend it on your food and ya rent fuck im doing it again so diz rent ill take it slow see rent is this thing where you know find a place and you pay money to stay monthly see i aint know if youre aware of it because you aint left your parents till your fuckin late 20s so according to you right on twitter you called me a manchild the audacity that you mister level headed adult you called me a manchild that is damn wild you were living with your mom and dad while i was in my own crib diggin up dirt on qp for that damn file back to that iron battle you know i gotta say the angle about jews not going to work on 9 11 kinda clever except you didnt go to work on 9 ever see down the line i went through shit my crew split as too did my creative drive my will to stay alive took a huge dip and my momma got too sick down to a toothpick and i stopped makin music see the sad thing is diz you said i tried and i flopped nah it was going fine then i stopped it was painful truly see i know it sounds sad but soul is still a joker though i aint talking about the gotham kind talking like that is what i was personified cause i lost track of all the kind of monsters i had caught inside especially the one whisperin to me that i oughta die so bottom line there is nothing you can say to me that is more evil than the shit i used to tell myself all the time i got out that coma i been frozen lately i gotta thanks all the homies that could motivate me even though the road was shaky like the way dizasters parents thought it was okay to hold a baby so now yall here to see my return to the format you here to be my personal doormat hold up before we go all that do battle rappers still say dumb shit like you catch a shell then you sleep like squirtle and snorlax no good well ignore that fantastic you know i respect you diz because youre willing to give someone the shirt off your back even when they didnt need it or were asking you for that he takes his shirt off all the time and i know you like to make fun of the way i make apologies lot of liberals are faker than astrology im not a liberal im a leftist and the difference is tremendous and theres one thing i have to say its gotta be legit i am sorry for every bomb that israel has ever launched at lebanon they always got a reason and each of them is fucking extra wrong the idf level houses you know bring fiery death on thousands maybe someone you knew nah i aint pushing no button but israeli government always said they do it in the name of the jews this aint a angle or a gimmick fuck the haters and the cynics but i refuse to accept that any jew is protected by doing something so fuckin hateful to you on top of all that and all the while the west bank has gotten terrorized every day in gazas genocide and america could end it by threatening to ends its ties but they just always defend it and the palestinians get left to die at this point diz probably thinkin this aint therapy diz that aint fair to me because i gotta grapple in my disgrace and my old battles are like your face theyve aged terribly and to everybody to all you who suggested no sjw stuff ive reviewed your request and shut the fuck up i know they hate it when i do this but sorry im accountable so i am sorry if i have hurt anyone who was marginalized with the words that id use especially cause it doesnt reflect my personal views i fucked up so much and thats being accountable being a fuckin shithead is not a fuckin alpha move and its like fuckin and im not talkin about like some light politeness like not talking when ya mouth is full im the only one reacting and thats why its the best line see what you refer to as political correctness is just giving some respect for a minute or a second its forethought and if you dismiss and reject it cause you think its makes you different or youre edgy youre not so what to do diz what are your preferred gender pronouns usually say like he him his whatever so mine are he him his look at how easy that it is it only takes fuckin two seconds but all these anti pc motherfuckers will complain for hours about it and how pc it is so let me make the math there are more than two genders your eyebrows look like two sweaters disgustingly huge pairs fuck tweezers use nair i bet the effort it takes to groom is tremendous if you have one square up there youd win at tetris i mean this in the kindest way so what happened everything that happened after math i have to ask should i be scared of you or do you only attack me if i dare you to diz diz cmon man are you wait a second am i getting this right will you do anything to anybody dares you to are you sure challenge accepted too bad consent negative my bad alright so jk you cant be that dont do that always say that anyway so challenge accepted diz i dare you to kiss me i mean my man i aint pausin shit i aint pausin shit in 2019 we past pausin hold up hold up can anyone else do this shit it aint scary or risky go back to the hotel share some whisky my girls okay with it cmon tough guy you gon kiss me or not cmon no you gon kiss me hold on this the important part cmon tough guy you gon kiss me or not put your money where your mouth iz king of the dot this was his plan to defuse all my shit is it my turn so no no man this is a long round im doing a long round for you its for you i dare you i dare to not rap forever and render this unwatchable i dare you to fight our friend math and not end up in the hospital i cant fly all the way to see it in any case i dare you to make a song that isnt absolute garbage so you could be an actual artist instead of pretending to be the rapper you arent but also sir i gotta say those braids they are ridiculous dude if you hate the culture vultures you officially lose you look like a white girl gettin her groove on a caribbean cruise but hold on diz is this some sort of style of hair of arabs im unaware of i mean this shit is you no this shit is new i remember the old days when your hair used to be you would see in a park full of skaters so many spikes it was like your barber was playing a game of mario maker if you wanna use sega your coif is a mess dawg out there looking like islamic the hedgehog wait a second though im sensitive to this shit is that offensive to yall or the you watching at home cause i felt it was like borderline sorta like when madness called me jew pac shalom which is funny diz my friend is is it offensive to you diz might be a reason to pretend that it is we both know a secret you oughta know let me take you back i recently remembered when you and i were at club excess in a pit like this doin shit like this and diz was saying this and that i wasnt listening you know what diz is like its a thing thing the moment that burned in my memory is when he turned and he said to me yo bro its funny i aint exactly muslim shit and i was like what good lord diz are you telling us that through your entire battling career and youve been battling for years a third of your life earning your stripes you led us to believe that youre muslim and this whole motherfucking time you never actually said one you not exactly i never was gonna say that see he says i never said i was a muslim but you say it in the battles not the interviews but every time the interviewer calls you muslim you never correct or interrupt him thats disgusting dont play i aint a bit amused cause im an offshoot of islam thats why nhhh yeah thats debatable but relatable so well no im talking in your relation on what you do you misrepresent yourself to your fans and to your opponents i want them to take themselves back to the moments and the raps that you told em using cultural standings that aint actually holding are you of the mind that just because racist thinks all arabs are in terror groups that that makes it fair for you to uphold the stereotypes of terror too what about muslims who arent arab dude you dont know think south asians and african muslims get hassled at customs or that their women in hijabs and burkas are afraid of getting shot and murdered due to the rise in fucking islamic anti islamic fervor so he has a rebuttal im sure that shit is subtle you know a lot of the old jewish lines i had were fucking foolish but the difference between that and you is im actually fucking jewish like this here was his decision and now we in this position you hate the cultures vultures what are you a religion pigeon i mean obviously youre arab so you know the language and the basic protocol but you faking overall i guess dizaster is just arabic for rachel dolezal either way you lied so these people have no reason to even slightly believe you or i have just freed you to finally be you diz do you hear this do you recognize the scheme see where im trying to lead you its soul khan from the last tribe of the hebrews listen diz you can admit it honestly you dont wanna do it out loud and thats just too much to ask though thats fine if youre not muslim just stand here looking like the worlds stupidest asshole oh damnit im so proud of you that probably took a lot of you right honestly i dont wanna do anything more on this verse but if this contest of a honor pride and our worth its just a motherfucking homicide in the first but if that aint enough you just get to serve me i dont give a fuck cause in 2021 your president is bernie diz you done i could be hold on i like you just wobbling back and forth diz cmon pull something out cmon rebuttal something no i dont want to right now just looking at you like sorta like wobbling yeah go diz its your turn oh its my turn yall ready for some shit what the fuck was that what the fuck was that ay trust me we gon get to the muslim in round 3 but right now woo we gotta address fucking mc dry milk this aint a battle this a race to see which one of us gon be the first to get this guy killed me or his white guilt fucking soul khan im not the person to step to yeah we gon start off with this because honestly im not here to psychologically test you im here to open up a door for everybody to get through just like a west hollywood rest room if i get mad today imma just say f you instead of wishing death on you ima just wish i never met you he wants to gender stuff we can all be men women too cmon even though yall dont believe it a lot of yall like to pretend to just like your mom did to fulfill the role of your pops when he left you left you without a dope beat to step to step one this a battle i aint gotta respect you step two you only here cause the rents due your bitch left you and the music not bringing the checks through step three he couldnt make a return unless he went against me the leader of the lgbt going against a wmd hes a proud sjw hes g l a d to be the ceo of a bunch of new groups a b c d e f gs the h i j k l m n o ps the q r s the t u vs and dont you forget those x y zs are you fucking kidding me you said you quit battle rap what you back here using us for you said you wouldnt return till you had a grammy you think we forgot the stupid shit you used to say and do from before you said you was done with this game you gon make go music and hit the booth and record i guess its safe to say hes back with the canadians since america couldnt give this jew no award juno award hold on hold on how long you gonna fucking hold on for its been 9 years of you holdin on recording songs we thought you would blow up by now man whats going on why have you not got put on i thought youd have some soul hits by now but you dont what a shocker khan chaka khan i thought brown bag was growin strong but now you trying to weasel your way in with us and sneak back in and just roll along and you want us to welcome you with open arms like im the vulture pff like we wouldnt notice you wrong right now you walkin in so many different directions you like a child outside tryin to find a pokémon and this is how all these silver spoon posers are the moment they dont get what they want thats the moment they gone and i stayed here puttin in blood sweat and tears helping put this culture on and that will always be the difference between your pros and your cons khans khan you a fuckin con artist you know what rhymes with soul khan what this guy spends more time with nancy pelosi than he does with his own mom but now hes back and hes focused on battle rap hes back like he never left returnin in the era of gun rhymes pickin the one guy that could give you punchlines and multis multiplied by hundred times of deaths so follow the pattern cause you aint getting the one liners yet fuck a gun rhyme bring your little anti gun sign cause i aint got a gun im here to contaminate ya bloodline with a rusty knife instead puncture puncture slice make your skull rupture like there was busted waterpipe of lead gushing by your head get your onion diced ill oven fry your egg cut and slice your chest open up ya eye with it leave it stuck inside your neck and watch the whole other side go dead like the butterfly effect they put a butter knife against a butterfly knife this is the different between cookie cutter rhymes and someone who designs lines to be cutting edge all you got is these lies you spread you literally talk out the side of your neck im really cut throat so if you running ya mouth youll catch a columbian necktie if i see a tongue comin out watch out you a bum now i been on my nate dogg shit watched ya high come down i became the professor of this campus you dropped out as a cub scout since you returned as one of my students well this could only one route oh you dont think im your teacher huh well you will when i blaow have you spittin your gums out phluh now you have a yuck mouth yukmouth you see the signs when the blood starts to come out speaking of cuttin you cut ya legacy short and you pressured to come back in the game cause youre stuck now and we supposed to welcome you like this successful legend like what the fuck how cause he got 3 000 000 views versus qp fuck wow since then i left that in a dust cloud while you spent the rest of your career like 50 cent trying to knock another son down got so outta touch hes like al bundy to us now which means ya battles with madness fox deacon qp would be your four famous touchdowns fuck outta here you like the gjonaj of polk high you wonder why he aint come down to no actual battles hes too busy at the farmers market tryin to haggle over free salad samples he went from being a savage asshole to hangin out with 6 foot women who wear versace sandals and have adams apples and before we got the horrible horrible horrible news that you quit you can admit this dude who was sick he just hasnt you know been the same dude ever since they surgically removed his dick he had a surgeon open up two little slits and fuse a clit made out of a pair of two human lips on to the passageway where he used to piss and if you think this is bad were lucky he hasnt grew any tits hes a fuckin neutered shih tzu with a uterus used to be a symbol of manhood like mr bruce but all we got left is this confused little bitch oops did i just say the b word you used to be as ruthless as it gets now you dont use the word bitch are you kidding me you bitch youre the biggest misogynist ever and you still are you dont get to change the rules as you wish you might be able to fool these stupid little new liberal groups that you with but the beautiful thing about the internet is that its forever and google is quick and youtube is just two little clicks click click exhibit a you once told a dude youre useless as a chick without the coochie and the tits listen useless as a chick without the coochie and the tits now i caught some slack for what i said to official but ill be honest this some futuristic shit now this same dudes a feminist man thats as stupid as it gets like you callin people gay for all three of your rounds on all your old youtube clips and now your excuse for it is that you grew up since and you werent worried about whose kids you were going to influence or is it truly this that your new political views dont fit with the way that you used to spit so you mustve turned vegan too cause all of a sudden you super quick to come to a fruits defense god damn man you too intense you suffering from self delusion of how you view yourself staring back at the mirror like who is this who am i who is this ill tell you who youre the dude who called people homos and queers for most your career so if you wanna act like were the ones that are homophobic here ehhh thats sorta weird cause i used to like you soul khan at least back then you were more sincere you once saw two dudes in the distance arguing about who says the word faggot more and you told the dude that was standing next to you yo hold my beer hes a fuckin fruit ninja the type that no one fears when he throws a bomb he throws a bomb but when the smoke screen clears he reappears with a picket sign and a pair of pink pointy ears like im soul khan ready to fight this war standing on the frontline with my big homie michael moore soul khan been a socialist for so long his hands and knees is sore had sunken cheekbones like a swedish whore he consumes twitter feeds he doesnt even eat no more hes no longer the person he used to be before just to act as his own manhood he has to speak to it through a ouija board i am literally raising hell and after this you might as well change your name as well ima make you hate yourself when you leave here you gonna feel the same way you felt when you watch the new dave chappelle face it you just

you im not in a battle gonna try to outrap or outflow you but on a track i will roast you because you adapt when the pro tools are tracking your vocals or at least thats whats born out of by some other examples well go through so namely you gave your mom a beautiful mothers day freestyle right it was gorgeous it was written down that does not make this better what im about to say my friend you gave your mom a freestyle for mothers day there had to be another way im talking flowers and cards instead of powerful bars if i was your mom i had wish you were a runaway and honestly when i started watching it get really intense body language gotta be anxious gotta inching forward like he was gonna pull the straps on her look like you were about to math hoffa ya damn momma now for the record if i you wanna watch this i made a shortcut tinyurl com dizmom alright please join with me if you watching at home or later on youtube because i love my mother too and ive got time my friend we gonna go through all this shit line by line actual quote diz said to his mom youre my sword when im swordless why in gods name did you record this hold on though if youre swordless then your hand or wherever you sheathe it by definition is not where your sword is bear with me if i gotta i break it down you understand just switch the metaphor with the shits thats intended for youre saying youre my mom and when im momless which my mom would be appalled if she thought i thought that she wanted such incompetent dog shits the next line is youre my spiritual fountain spiritual fountain i wanna hear all about them my friend is a spiritual fountain more like a lyrical fountain or a miracle fountain spiritual fountain the last line of this blew my mind with this youre my breath when im drowning now when you drown you lose air so based on the sequence of the line and the meaning thats implied she is not keeping you alive she is leaving you to die but honestly she seems really kind no disrespect intended to your mom especially cause all the shit diz has said and done its amazing diz isnt done so can we clap it up for dizasters mom now the next example is a song thats actually your best if that were case for me i would be massively impressed its called dont play me produced by chase moore that means the best aspect of a track aint yours literally said imma say this real slow for everyone to see this was written down too right it is oh cmon ill strike you with a midas touch and grab your wife and fuck till the hymen bust open like a fire hydrant wide and fire trucks driving sideways on the highways till i fuck my tires up i guess in that fires are chaotic and fuck everything up but like now because i am a masochist and ive got time we gon tackle this line by line hold on by the way tinyurl com dontplaydiz oh i forgot hold on wait a second you know what rhymes with tinyurl com dizmom diz lied about his bond with islam okay so look back to this this magnum opus so ill strike you with a midas touch and grab your wife and fuck so the touch of midas turn whatever you hold into genuine gold like its treasure in a vault so what you saying is if someone gave you this incredible ability you would use it to commit sexual assault you are a great ambassador for this culture by the way lets go to this till the hymen bust open like a fire hydrant wide and fire trucks jesus christ i guess youre not aware that hymens dont bust actually kinda tear even then its a misconception thats kinda rare diz do you know what a hymen looks like hold on do you know what a vagina looks like i see the gears turning i hear them ears burning he wants to rebuttal me like of course ive seen a vagina its standing right in front of me auhh im in oakland now im standing over here in oakland next line this the wild shit like a fire hydrant wide and fire trucks driving sideways on the highways till i fuck my tires up are you the fire truck like a transformer are you stunt driving like the transporter are you like some fireman deplorably ignoring his last order i dont get it diz the problem is also here is that the wife would also end up gold right story there somewhat i cant tell if youre trying to cuckold or fuck gold and i dont know if this is a minus or plus but if shes making of gold the hymen wont bust and you know gold thats strong material you know whats not strong material ya song material and thats ya best song goddammit its frustrating i want to set up a rap camp and well see you this summer ness can teach you flow mac can teach you structure maybe i dont know i dont know people are new geechi gotti would be an instructor to help you not sound like such a geeky motherfucker but i dont sound that weird diz those beautiful braids when i said you oughta to explore your artistry more i didnt mean you should cosplay as the guitarist from korn this is you every time you perform to me youre nothing but a future corpse if this fragile little jewish dork even imagines using force i will luchadore slam his little form and use him as a tuning fork no one gives a fuck about the stupid music you perform i will build you a casket fill it with padding just for keeping the acoustics warm im hotter than the human torch which is actually funny cause if you were born back in the 20s in your grandparents country you would be a human torched you are only the goat because all jews were born with a pair of hooves and horns you want us to think youre destined to kill a man nah you look like you stuck between steps in the thriller dance and you still advance if i had to change ya name to encapsulate the raid of trash you aggregate it would be edward fillerhands what was that advice that patrick had told you relax let em go loose but yet every time you use your arms im imagining goku at the supermarket examining produce diz you always down for unlimited rounds like you solid snake heres something you should consider now consolidate im here to marie kondo out your closet space you have always lived in but never exist in an islamic state you are getting so fucked up that it could become someones fetish complete with its own subreddit i hope that one of my old fans came to oakland and grew up to become medics cause this level of blood shedding is upsetting like a pump of unleaded fuck buttin heads i am getting ready to behead him khans flow a c cowlings with the bronco kicking over lawn gnomes you be dropping n bombs and you aint got the launch codes oakland california can you hit me with the amen ay man sicker than a vape pen diz be always whining like an infant in his playpen begging for respect that hes never gonna get like ricky and his grade 10 for me nothing youll ever say is gonna hurt me cause in 2021 son the president is bernie wow thank god yall ready for rapping again now when soul khan around anyone from the sons even the lesser ones its like he can smell it in the air earlier today he met brixx belvedere and he

im not with the sons anymore ah ha i caught you now feel the wrath as the lightening strikes down if conceited dont wanna battle me fuck it brixx ill battle your right now bernie bernie bernie this fuckin pacifist passive aggressive attitude obviously isnt workin cause bro all you do is judge people and talk about politics and if you think thats okay thats obviously a problem you need to solve first then cause its probably no worse than somebody who spends all of his time absorbing other peoples opinions online to the point they actually forget to be their own person he introduces himself as hi im a socialist why dont you say im noah first then help us help you discover your core version cause even though you lost as fuck i dont gotta be up here with you soul searchin i cant even find you theres no person you used to be merciless no mercy then went cold turkey no cursin even ripped up the old verses where he wrote cursive fell flat on his back then returned to the old circuit lookin so nervous feelin more worthless shaking below surface its unfortunate when you decide to put the word soul in your name and find out you aint got a soul or a sole soul purpose its over its not even at the end of the show and its closed curtains ima put him in a bag and zip him up cause im focused now so if one of these little guys in the crowd try to interrupt i dont give a fuck listen i came here to rip you up if this is your hero then i must really be a heel cause im only a couple inches away from having soul sole lifted up you a baby chihuahua bitch boy which means you bark like you big and tough but you really just a little pup and you aint ready for the final level of contra bitch your hearts not big enough yeah he wants to protest against the guns bernie but go ahead i dont need one long blade split down the middle but the edge is rough ill fuckin ill fuckin ill fuckin ill slice under the belly and give him a little nip and tuck ill create a new move called the sitting duck ill vertically swing it up and knock the lash off his eyeball before he can even blink it once you think i give a fuck you think i give a fuck if the crews filming us yeah put this on film and just rearrange your facial features on camera and twist ya little pixels up ill completely ruin your definition and get to slicing and get to edit stuff and finish up with slicing sound i call that the directors cut and guess what what it still isnt enough i gotta send it back to the blacksmith so he can sharpen the ridges and add the finishing touch bing now its welded smooth and its extra new i call it the confession booth cause itll make you spill your guts you fuckin little bitch i e d in the building underneath your feet ill blow this whole building up you wouldnt survive the blast if you rolled up here with the same armor on as gizmoduck bitch all you got is the 1 2 1 2 simple punch recycled puns played out ones same typical order cliché fat joke cliché race joke and he doesnt even think of the jokes hes an internet quoter this is literally the billy crystal of windows explorer but youre more of a nerd with a mental disorder which makes you joaquin phoenix cause you not even the original joker bitch you know what you are ha he said he makes music you a shitty performer you a little fuckin leftist libby little sissy new yorker you a dime a dozen hipster making his songs with his little rhythms on his mini recorder then transfers them into his home studio through his mini controller you think i give a fuck about being a political soldier or a registered voter you right bitch im from the mountains of the yeah and ima go out smokin in the middle of a forest gettin lit like christopher dorner you talkin to someone whos really been in a war i have crossed the syrian border versus someone who speaks on our shit like a distant reporter like oh no those kids got hit by a mortar well vote for bernie and hell pass that executive order fuck bernie sanders you a fuckin hypocrite fresco actually i like bernie but the point is you a hypocrite you this is someone who literally told fresco he was gay cause he was into yoga then nine years later he goes on queenzflip and tells him that hes into yoga i dont know if its me or him or hes trying to undo every line hes ever said you went from accusing people of being homosexual for slightly wearing their pants tight around their legs to letting a grown man help you put your own legs behind your head yeah man youre some type of tough rapper all that learning how to do pilates and shit there can only be one answer hes trying to learn how to become more flexible so the next time he becomes depressed over trump he can curl up in a ball that much faster fuck trump fuck dizaster hes an activist for the poor democrat pamphlets on the board so i showed up to his house cause i was curious what was all this activism for soon as i got to his front steps i was greeted by two buff ass tomboys with their arms crossed standing at the door they said whats the password i said faggot one of them raised their hands like this and said you now have access to the floor i said thanks but im not going in well why not i said cause this is kinda sorta really not my thing wait a minute are you a homophobe homoph nah i love gay people thats when the other one said thats it ive had enough of your shit man you need to leave bro and thats when i said bro you just assumed my gender well yeah youre totally a bro man i was like what im not a woman im not in between and im not a man well what are you then i said im a a i identify as a plant i said a plant but bro you cant i said wait a minute are you a plant aphobe plant aphobe aw aw nah were totally not plantaphobes we love plants i said well then you will address me as that do you understand actually i do understand like like how youre going through self expression like a vegan going through depression i totally can dig it man i mean plant i mean plant fuck i mean plant sorry thats what its like dealing with you idiots i mean plant god fuckin damn goddamn i forgot the part i gotta freestyle now you not a real jew i didnt have no jew bars until now you dont rock a fedora wait you not a real jew you rock a fedora you not a real jew you dont follow the torah you got led lightbulbs in your home you dont got no menorah you not from jerusalem you from eastside sodom and gomorrah and over there you control the set speaking of gomorrah gamora im marveled at how your personalities both connect when i walk you off close to the ledge and watch you drop onto the rocks over the edge what you dont get it ima have soul stoned to death bitch we been on our grizzly while you overslept a fuckin california bear whos been in the new york zoo for so long he became a domesticated home owners pet that shit you was cryin on blogs you was supposed to get i stayed here and got those enormous checks cause i kept on workin wakin up in cold sweats workin on these words learnin how to make more metaphors connect while you got a legacy thats a rolodex of homophobic insults to the most effect you spit shit that your political views dont reflect but youve grown up since youve changed now youre not a sexist you quit it like you would let a racist white guy tell you you know what im no longer racist and you gon let me get away with it you a fuckin hypocrite contradict yourself in every statement you make you just too fake to admit it cause youre really a closet fuckin racist and thats why you got so many regrets and the difference between me and you is i had a clean conscious when i said it you understand me this guy got nothin but basic linguistics hes way too simplistic he gave up and quit jeffrey epstein its clear he was never able to hang to begin with aw shit this shit is painful he gon get a face full of stitches paid in full shit yeah ima get creative with this you think i hate you cause of your race yall are the chosen ones man an old generation thats bathing in riches im just mad at you cause youre the only jew that hasnt created a business how scary is this my race angles are very vicious i can put an end to a conversation with a jew with two words merry christmas i fear like theres gotta be an explanation of the actual definition of hypocrisy so a hypocrite is someone who says one thing and does different shit whereas i changed my entire life so your criticism doesnt apply and heres another thing that you should regard quick i didnt flop like i said i quit music for a while youre a terribly listener no wonder your music is garbage you think im a bigger geek than you my friend youre an anime obsessed fucking weeaboo i heard that got married congratulations do you call her your waifu like the awkwardest white dude did you propose to her with cherry blossoms and haikus if it werent for the fact that she probably wipes you id say she probably feels like she got a 9th grader when she asks you to clean the bathroom and youre like you mean the hyperbolic time chamber what about the sex is it hotter when you roleplay as inuyasha and kagome now do you think diz is ever domestically violent heck no id say he never try it and every time him and his wife get into a fight she finds a way to let go while you go in your basement and write her name in the death note diz talks about the streets he isnt from there hes from our neighborhood where the hot topic is that hot topic was replaced by pacific sunwear and the fact that you share a zip code with just goes to show you aint naturally large you just actually scarred and have low impulse control are you okay man youre doing okay youll get through with it and thats why your parents are afraid youll share the fate of sharon tate so every black friend of dizaster is a professional actor that his parents paid to scare him straight its not working i think i have a question they probably bail you out of all sorts of stupid shit that you do so it is imma have to ask you are you actually cool with the fact that you supported trump and therefore backed a political movement that doesnt actually consider black people a human you okay man you look so upset so ill say this leupold good snooze hes falling asleep falling asleep okay cool i heard your guns are lethal popping with them tools correction all your guns are legal officer approved cause aint nothing more gangster than following the rules something that i noticed when you first around you didnt spit gun bars a lot when you came into the circuit how was it crafting them waiting till they were perfect did you wanna hone them even more wait till you deserved it i got it now you aint spit gun bars cause you were waiting for a permit very responsible of you you always like to say that americans have rights correction america always has arabs in its sights america has rights no america has kids in cages terrorized by ice im telling you and asking you man to man go talk about american rights to the tombstone of sandra bland youre a new husband some day a prospective father talk about american rights to the grandkids and kids of eric garner diz i agree that in many ways clinton wouldve been a evil killer but the communities i work with are truly getting hurt diz and a lot of it is because that motherfucker stephen miller who is it oh golly shit man stephen miller the opponent by the guy you voted for and i know you changed your mind but you cant change your time its kinda weird right now it fucks me up a little bit i know this aint your typical wordplay work day but its a little disturbing you aint know who stephen miller is but you probably know like piccolos birthday see i have changed diz its proof you dont agree cause you dont believe in evolution no like you dont actually believe in evolution like the theory of charles darwin the theory of evolution you dont believe in evolution its the reason that were human but i do remember you have a thing for schrödingers cat well the man schrödinger that conceived it and concluded it that even he fucking believed in evolution you know what rhymes with schrödinger too he was inspired by einstein socialist jew diz what you gonna do if battle rap vanishes alright what you gonna do where would you shift in your life i mean real deal is a educator ooops was a legislator fuck what are you dizaster whispers a detonator a son of privilege riding on a golden escalator with the social skills of a 2nd grader my man you need to find something to shift your life i still got music just started again let me give you some advice find a mission that might not pay a lot but make you feel like you got skin in the fight hell keep talkin about socialism maybe you could join our organization dsa come with us on this journey cause in 2021 i know you about this the president is bernie alright man that was cool jesus christ i dont mean no offense by that by the way see cracking jokes and laughing is fine but lets get back to the stats and the actual signs your total impact on battle rap is 12 000 000 views you have racked up online in comparison i have 13 000 000 on one battle so technically one match up of mine has more views on it than all your battles combined yeah you have the battle in mind but its the cancerous kind the type that thinks hmm all these battlers are doin is just passin their time but if they cant use this to boost their music then that cant get no shine til someone shows him a picture of tsu surf and he takes off his glasses hmmm i cant really see that im actually blind and this is how he was actin when he was back in his prime i want you guys to try to imagine what he wouldve acted like if he actually got signed im soul khan and all you mcs are peasants let that sink in for a second and tell me this dude here is on my level when he hasnt even shown yall enough love or wrote enough history and i still say this to little bro respectfully a two year stretch is like bill bellemy thats a joke of a legacy so whether he do or dont have any respect for me in the end im still considered the legend on every top ten you see if you even say the word battle rap my resume alone will force you to mention me im memorable because of my work ethic of course they remember me the respect we have for you is only present because we as a culture selfishly kept you alive in our collective memories because besides that you havent done anything youre prevalent cause we make your relevant and thats a closed case and a no brainer like jf kennedy ill bet you a dead president half of these people forgot your name but for our sake for our sake soul khan starts laughing oh dont laugh cause yeah its okay they probably forgot your name but we still gotta give you a little star on battle raps walk of fame just not on hollywood boulevard yours would be laid down on memory lane and thats the realest shit anybodys ever wrote about you cause you wanna be this voice for the people but your body of work dont add up to what you socially amount to i got my crown jewels cause i show and prove strictly off ground moves while you got a status quo that exists merely cause the people around you subjectively gave it its value dont you get it without us you dont have you and without me they dont have views so without this battle the fans lose and if you ever question who i am to this scene im everything bitch thats who and you the little jokey jokey kid who only poses a risk wrist when he poses like this uh oh i think hes forming a flip hes about to channel the inner charron from his dick he makes jokes about himself cause thats his only defense but what kind of lack of testosterone is this hes gon become some kind of leftist hollywood director i can see it now workin on his own little script relaunching new episodes soul khan presents zena the warrior prince this guy went from a full blown chauvinist to an emotional bitch look i understand that you regret being so homophobic but you need to get over it quick dont be like jussie smollett now and beat yourself up over this shit because of course youre not homophobic bro we know that cause youre really gay in secret last time you passed out at a frat house they drew a dick on your forehead while you were sleepin and the first thing you said when you woke up and peeped it was ima keep it so thats all you had the little homophobic kiss me angle you was gonna come back with the offer still stands to cover up the fact that you were consistently callin people homo as one of your habits you wanna know something bro you know whats really gay when they asked you if you had love for battle rap still and you answered back with i dont know if ive ever had it soul khan in our world thats the definition of a beep of course he gets no passes if he recycles he should be judged like all the mcs he said oh i dont know if i can catch up on these battles to know if im reusing a bar or a scheme but thats the point dummy its pretty much a logical thing you wouldnt have to watch 1 000 000 battles in a row if you actively cared enough to still be a part of the scene but you wouldnt have to catch up if you were here thats what makes you a foreigner but what does all of this mean it means you failed as a battle rapper and you failed to go mainstream so now you this lost underground backpacker thats caught in between wanting to make bars or do a song where you sing so soul khan youll always be a man of many willy wonka hats but youll never be the boss of one thing so tell me what you planning to do with all this you self deprecating jew apologist i know youre reformed now but to me youre every isist and ologist there probably is you made a living off of calling people fruit balls youre basically a rupaul ogist all these things make it all too obvious khan is a true communist but this is americana and what khan insists on dont make no kinda sense we on some reconnaissance you know who my gang is khan dont make me genghis khan your shit death by a thousand cuts ill leave him with all kinds of body slits when the katina leaves cuts in him deep as the mariana trench im fast as mayweather you may die now quick pull up on him maradona kick ill dangle you from a cedar tree like a pinata then bat you with a fuckin hockey stick and keep beatin your body with it until the candy w rapper thats inside of you eventually falls out of it i fucking beep beep beep take a fuckin time bomb and shove it down your esophagus have you coughing up blobs of phosphorus since youre a narcissist you shouldnt have a problem when someone makes you swallow your own confidence ill curb stomp this erin brockovitch lookin nerd off of his high horse then drag him by force from his nerdy ass little work offices ill put him in a dirt plot put the earth on top of it i could put him in a box or a bag but this what he gon earn urn off of this a fermented body in a reserved spot in a fully furbished german sarcophagus this is the most violent socialist inside your metropolis he wants to strike over politics ready to riot outside the white house in washington getting into a dildo fight with milo yiannopoulos he said if it wasnt for the music he mightve destroyed all of us pssst well lets look at the ergonomics and purpose of this worthless comment your verses has always been full of meaningless words so no one gives a fuck about your new learning process we never got to see the work in progress im a murderous terminologist a wordsmith and a workaholic you a dirty socialist that never earned shit but feel like you deserve a profit capital one tell me whats in your wallet you said you cant focus on battle rap cause music is your obligation well lets contemplate on khans template lets spend a moment in a world of khans creations his ancestors used to get fucked up in concentration camps but he stays with a camp that fucks up his concentration if you ask me i think khan is in his own constellation his concept is so convoluted and drawn far outta context that for me its confirmation if they ever held a nomination who had the best content that khan verse converse wouldnt even be in the conversation who does name flips like that how many concerts has khan conducted how many projects has he conjured up or khan constructed ill tell yall nothing so of course he gonna talk about my accomplishments i fucked up a lot of times those were the hands i was dealt but you aspire to battle people like aspire so naturally youll never understand how battling someone like canibus or cassidy felt because you packed up and left only to return like kim kardashian and make an ass out yourself cause what you say im done theres no battlers left but a real battle rapper doesnt beg for no hand outs or never asks for no help im the man because i became a man that can stand by himself and you here cause you battling dizaster thats it you dont have nothing else im on a different level i single handedly branded myself i shouldnt even have to meddle metal with these little pussies like a chastity belt im glad i came down to oakland to give him this ass whippin he just panders to the crowd acts like he cares about black culture he just usin black culture to push him he drops one line about civil rights and the whole crowd overlooks him but if you really believe the whites were gentrifying your city you wouldve moved yourself the fuck outta brooklyn you are literally an invader on a black mans turf and youre jewish which makes it that much worse literally youre the problem youre trying to take out and its the same way back in the day the grindtime situation played out you say r i p ph but when he alive you did him like a two faced snake lucky for you back then the little dirt never came out but i got the info and then some how he was helping you get some battles back when you couldnt even get your shit done he was giving you views helping you build them back up when you couldnt get none he even gave you cortez that was your biggest name back then he matched you against him and then as soon as the opportunity to battle on url comes you left him hanging on his next event you bailed out and you ditched him a straight sucker from the maze runner i wanna see you climb your way outta this one man aint no safe house or escape routes im pulling out the big guns the big ones the type to make elizabeth warren and adam schiff run aks with the twin drums i call em soul crushers scope on top your dome gettin popped i put soul in a box like ghostbusters yall remember ghostbusters dan aykroyd bill murray when they trapped slimmer in that little box in the beginnin hes like no i prefer the ghostbusters version where they casted the women of course soul khan and i like women i love women a lot but what type of women are you talking about the ones that take photos for king of the dot whoa it looks like were going straight to the source oh well i guess soul khan is only here now because hes going through a really rough divorce and its funny because he come in here like he has this master plan oh but yall dont understand this fam that no matter how you slice it we lookin at a queenless person this is half a man hes a half of the king he used to be he has half of his throne half of his belongings and only half of what he owns so you can talk about my marriage im happily married i dont have a problem letting that shit be known id rather be that than this fuckin depressed little fuckin bachelor that doesnt have a home behind this fuckin feminist curtain theres a man thats sad and alone he wanted to make all the women in the world happy but he couldnt even make his own woman happy at home and she gone now aint no tellin what ya ex bitch might do he said he wants to be a black man for the activist he just mad his white ass found out his wife does too but hold on to hope soul khan your dreams might come true if she really your soul mate then wait nine years and maybe shell make a comeback just like you and he thought i was gonna have 6 000 000 jew jokes like i was gonna talk about hitler when hes wasted ten years of his life with a photographer chick and he still doesnt get the picture or maybe he does and the rest is just numb cause the relationship dipped into a dark room and eventually developed into a negative one rumor is after you got married you stopped battling cause she didnt let you which is ironic cause your timing of coming back is soon as she left you you need to face the music she left you naked and made you look stupid but hey in a way she was perfect for you cause she ended up walking away from the ring the same way that you did that shit is oh so cold she walked in and she told you go i dont know man it sounds like she signed a record deal or something cause that chick really sold her soul maybe its because youre always going on about trump trump this trump that trump he did this republican that government that government this always up in somebodys mix to the point he left no attention to the special someone hes with what part of this doesnt he get your wife left you because of this shit probably had enough of you running your lip then shes probably out there right now aggressively suckin some republicans dick and thats just the hypothetical heres where we cause the most damage im really sorry about this ammo cause this shit gon get volcanic cause its ahh kinda ahh i kinda heard before she wanted to be with you she wanted to be with organik oh man and thats the bro travis when he asked you for this battle he was like bro have it same way he answered you when you asked about her he was like bro have it oh man oh fuckin dammit i dont even like getting this personal these are your tactics you the one that brought up qps baby mama his son his child support and his taxes you the fuckin one that brought up sandusky versus rone cause you felt like it would be so savage you the one that brought up real deals son in not one but multiple matches so spare me this victim bullshit cause your karma here is solely from the role that you practice now onto our parents you know how mad i get when people talk about my parents oh man oh man now what about our parents bro huh what about our parents my mom is a math teacher and your mom is a librarian clerk librarian clerk but why are we comparing them because women teachers they queens they deserve all the praise minimum wage they deserve all the raise they the most underappreciated in a way then comes your mom sitting behind a desk stamping books twiddling her thumbs all day a library clerk thats why her son came out into books like a nerd thats where the mother son similarities occur cause my mother is a math teacher and i came out to be a math teacher just like her now hold on let me talk about my dad since everybody wants to talk about him my fathers dad passed away when my dad was only 19 alright his name was bachir just like me he had three younger brothers and a little sister so now forced to raise them on his own he had no chance but to look for a bigger picture in 1976 my pops saved up and bought his first car had it on top of the hill just parked on it and thats when the civil war got started a dude named michel aoun and the christian armed forces dropped a bomb on it now when i say christian yall assume that im muslim right but im druze im not muslim but i loved them they my brothers but back then we was in a holy land grab over religion a world driven by sectarianism you wouldnt the meaning of a fucked up system the people where im from will die to live where you live in to eat the food that you eat to sip the water you drink and thats the reason you saw me protesting but since you a spoiled little american brat ima explain america to you through my eyes to teach you this lesson now lets go back to the 70s where i left you in that last scene where michel aoun blew up my fathers car in front of our house in baakleen now this is where he knew he had to leave if he was to expand the family tree but life there was lookin hopeless so the only place that couldve gave us this life was the land of the free this is why i love america because my dad came here to build a path just for me and after that he went bankrupt and we moved permanently those next eight years would make me everything that i am in the street playing soccer bare feet kickin the can in the fuckin mud til the sun came down shit that really turned a kid to a man but that was when you were in woodland hills with this little gameboy in ya hand so you wouldnt really understand would you yeah cause all we had was to be able to go out and play but as lebanese kids we were taught to be appreciative that in a way even though all we had was cold showers most of the time and four hours of electricity during the day i lived through this shit and through the rest of my settlement my country would be going through this development now listen you remember how i said the dude that blew up my dads car in the first segment okay this is why the whole thing is relevant this is the reason i said the shit cause that same person 30 years later has now been elected as our president were talking about somebody whos a political war criminal who executed thousands by his hand hes killed everything i love and thats the reason i wave this flag you hate the president of america because i understand his policies make you mad hes a goof i know the tweets make you sad but guess what i hate my president because he fuckin broke up half my nation and damn near took away my dad and listen this is real shit they wanna start a holy war with muslims druze and christians but i will never go back to the ways that are old tradition i would rather go over there and die with them then fight with them those are my brothers those are my sisters i look at them like they my children now listen i understand theres inequality here towards blacks in this system that has nothing to do with him i dont care how he sees the views if theyve never been used against him so for what its worth you right im not muslim i am druze alright do you know what that means that means we are under walid jumblatt we are socialist by birth that means i can tell you firsthand that were supposed to be the most peaceful people on earth i mean were supposed to be peaceful at birth but if you push us we can be some of the most fuckin violent people on earth and the point being is that youre a fuckin wanna be socialist you dont know what youre screwing with socialism is in my fucking bloodline and i want nothing to do with it because i know first hand bro trust me ive lived under this socialist government shit ill tell you first hand that nothing gets fixed the garbage doesnt even get picked up no one gives a fuck about shit but you wouldnt understand because you an inexperienced uncultured son of a bitch this aint about the joke you living or the votes you gettin in the real world people carry guns then die over socialism you want us to live in this global prison where we take orders from these fuckin old tradition senior citizens that are four times older than him so the main point you aint never been through nothing like this and go back to what we were saying on our parents alright this is what it means to be a lebanese american its the journey its where we came from and where our parents been so since you think you gon talk about my parents ima use my own parents to embarrass him back to when we was talkin about your mom being a librarian but lets go to your dad now you heard my dads story oh you ready you heard my pops story his struggle was hard he came here and turned an emotional scar and made himself to a star and im following in his footsteps which proves your pops is always a reflection of who you are but what about your dad he was a piece of shit well he was a lawyer and that could be respected but then what happened he lost his bar and became an unemployed fucking loser taking business calls from his car wait a minute thats not all he was a musician like you he wanted to top the charts he thought itd go far hibbity har har har and just like you i doubt youll make a career out of this ever since youre admitting hes a shitty role model then let me spend the rest of this to teach you how to do better your pops at 19 got a deal with capitol records compared to what happened to my dad at 19 thats substantially better like way better but then what happened he got dropped before he could put out any records and he was being managed by phil spector like thats the beatles manager like how fuckin bad can you be like this is where your fuckin personalities connect accurately because you both went to new york to become the man you could be i guess its true what they say the big apple doesnt fall far from the family tree aw man everything about you is what makes you such a lame ass loser im too advanced this like a cave man with his tools to a space man with a computer a space man with a computer wait a minute fuck it you wanna know what the fuckin joke was about so who guessed the riddle i was putting out lucy a drug dealer with a hangover coco you plus me equals human cousins caesar what are these names of evolution primates so to clear up the confusion this about to be rebuttaled to everything he just said about the evolution now first of all on the evolutionary chart our most common oldest ancestor on earth would be lucy now lucy is our oldest ancestor technically like a human fused with an animal by battle rap standards that would be the beginning for us juice vs supernatural now most of our class evolved from that those are the ancestors that both connect us and then theres you on the evolutionary chart outta nowhere with the gay jokes you would be you would be homoerectus now the anatomy of homoerectus anatomy wise they were flat and small they were loud they had tiny hands they were small they had no balls and that was all they thrived during the grindtime era pay attention this is gonna get crazy they thrived during the grindtime era along with the emergence of a new group of hominids those were called the neanderthals the grindtime white guys predominantly white they felt like they had it all they came into the game as giants which allowed them to stand up tall but eventually their lack of culture will allow them to succumb to a massive fall which predicated the rise of the cro magnon man were movin along the chart the cro magnon man in our standards that would be the url rapper the chrome magnum man now ironically enough this the first man to use the tools and everything was cool but eventually they couldnt come up with anything new and they hit the ceiling limit of their genetic pool then comes the final transformation into todays modern homosapiens me lux mook pat illmac the saurus ice goodz shine people that been here for generations and most of them branched way out through these changes including me i went through every single one of these evolutionary changes hold wait thats why i got it down to a mathematic perfection cause now im giving you a timeline which is an accurate projection of where we had this connection and where we last left off at the last intersection cause you had no battles left so it threw a monkey wrench in what was then your rapid progression which then lead you to get wiped out by natural selection do i know about evolution maybe now this is where you learn something new here cause evolution aint the only thing that i can do we almost done i need you to focus with me were waaay past half way here were almost at the end we at the end we way past half way here im gonna need some crowd participation are you guys awake here crowd cheers alright pull out your phones right now and trust me i got all day i could stay here google infinite monkey tell me what that say here a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for infinite about of time will surely complete works of william shakespeare william shakespeare ooh thats another picture i put out the sixth clue they say if a infinite amount of monkeys type on an infinite amount of typewriters in an infinite amount of universes they should be able to replicate the work of shakespeare but later on this theory would disprove itself and actually say that for that to be possible the probability of it is the closest number to zero and this is why me and you will never be equal this is what separates us from monkeys as people because you see even if you took a million trillion infinite soul khans in a trillion trillion universes you will never be able to truly replicate the truest purpose of this humans verses and thats why i made this to let you know that you could never reach me i became an advanced being in this and you will always be that fuckin monkey underneath me pussy time,en

35,Wouldn't It Be Nice - Stereo / Remastered,The Beach Boys,2Gy7qnDwt8Z3MNxqat4CsK,to start with look at all the books there were her edith wharton novels arranged not by title but date of publication there was the complete modern library set of henry james a gift from her father on her twenty first birthday there were the dog eared paperbacks assigned in her college courses a lot of dickens a smidgen of trollope along with good helpings of austen george eliot and the redoubtable brontë sisters there were a whole lot of black and white new directions paperbacks mostly poetry by people like h d or denise levertov there were the colette novels she read on the sly there was the first edition of couples belonging to her mother which madeleine had surreptitiously dipped into back in sixth grade and which she was using now to provide textual support in her english honors thesis on the marriage plot there was in short this mid size but still portable library representing pretty much everything madeleine had read in college a collection of texts seemingly chosen at random whose focus slowly narrowed like a personality test a sophisticated one you couldn t trick by anticipating the implications of its questions and finally got so lost in that your only recourse was to answer the simple truth and then you waited for the result hoping for artistic or passionate thinking you could live with sensitive secretly fearing narcissistic and domestic but finally being presented with an outcome that cut both ways and made you feel different depending on the day the hour or the guy you happened to be dating incurably romantic these were the books in the room where madeleine lay with a pillow over her head on the morning of her college graduation she d read each and every one often multiple times frequently underlining passages but that was no help to her now madeleine was trying to ignore the room and everything in it she was hoping to drift back down into the oblivion where she d been safely couched for the last three hours any higher level of wakefulness would force her to come to grips with certain disagreeable facts for instance the amount and variety of the alcohol she d imbibed last night and the fact that she d gone to sleep with her contacts in thinking about such specifics would in turn call to mind the reasons she d drunk so much in the first place which she definitely didn t want to do and so madeleine adjusted her pillow blocking out the early morning light and tried to fall back to sleep but it was useless because right then at the other end of her apartment the doorbell began to ring early june providence rhode island the sun up for almost two hours already lighting up the pale bay and the smokestacks of the narragansett electric factory rising like the sun on the brown university seal emblazoned on all the pennants and banners draped up over campus a sun with a sagacious face representing knowledge but this sun the one over providence was doing the metaphorical sun one better because the founders of the university in their baptist pessimism had chosen to depict the light of knowledge enshrouded by clouds indicating that ignorance had not yet been dispelled from the human realm whereas the actual sun was just now fighting its way through cloud cover sending down splintered beams of light and giving hope to the squadrons of parents who d been soaked and frozen all weekend that the unseasonable weather might not ruin the day s festivities all over college hill in the geometric gardens of the georgian mansions the magnolia scented front yards of victorians along brick sidewalks running past black iron fences like those in a charles addams cartoon or a lovecraft story outside the art studios at the rhode island school of design where one painting major having stayed up all night to work was blaring patti smith shining off the instruments tuba and trumpet respectively of the two members of the brown marching band who had arrived early at the meeting point and were nervously looking around wondering where everyone else was brightening the cobblestone side streets that led downhill to the polluted river the sun was shining on every brass doorknob insect wing and blade of grass and in concert with the suddenly flooding light like a starting gun for all the activity the doorbell in madeleine s fourth floor apartment began clamorously insistently to ring the pulse reached her less as a sound than as a sensation an electric shock shooting up her spine in one motion madeleine tore the pillow off her head and sat up in bed she knew who was ringing the buzzer it was her parents she d agreed to meet alton and phyllida for breakfast at 7 30 she d made this plan with them two months ago in april and now here they were at the appointed time in their eager dependable way that alton and phyllida had driven up from new jersey to see her graduate that what they were here to celebrate today wasn t only her achievement but their own as parents had nothing wrong or unexpected about it the problem was that madeleine for the first time in her life wanted no part of it she wasn t proud of herself she was in no mood to celebrate she d lost faith in the significance of the day and what the day represented she considered not answering but she knew that if she didn t answer one of her roommates would and then she d have to explain where she d disappeared to last night and with whom therefore madeleine slid out of the bed and reluctantly stood up this seemed to go well for a moment standing up her head felt curiously light as if hollowed out but then the blood draining from her skull like sand from an hourglass hit a bottleneck and the back of her head exploded in pain in the midst of this barrage like the furious core from which it emanated the buzzer erupted again she came out of her bedroom and stumbled in bare feet to the intercom in the hall slapping the speak button to silence the buzzer hello what s the matter didn t you hear the bell it was alton s voice as deep and commanding as ever despite the fact that it was issuing from a tiny speaker sorry madeleine said i was in the shower likely story will you let us in please madeleine didn t want to she needed to wash up first i m coming down she said this time she held down the speak button too long cutting off alton s response she pressed it again and said daddy but while she was speaking alton must have been speaking too because when she pressed listen all that came through was static madeleine took this pause in communications to lean her forehead against the door frame the wood felt nice and cool the thought struck her that if she could keep her face pressed against the soothing wood she might be able to cure her headache and if she could keep her forehead pressed against the door frame for the rest of the day while somehow still being able to leave the apartment she might make it through breakfast with her parents march in the commencement procession get a diploma and graduate she lifted her face and pressed speak again daddy but it was phyllida s voice that answered maddy what s the matter let us in my roommates are still asleep i m coming down don t ring the bell anymore we want to see your apartment not now i m coming down don t ring she took her hand from the buttons and stood back glaring at the intercom as if daring it to make a sound when it didn t she started back down the hall she was halfway to the bathroom when her roommate abby emerged blocking the way she yawned running a hand through her big hair and then noticing madeleine smiled knowingly so abby said where did you sneak off to last night my parents are here madeleine said i have to go to breakfast come on tell me there s nothing to tell i m late how come you re wearing the same clothes then instead of replying madeleine looked down at herself ten hours earlier when she d borrowed the black betsey johnson dress from olivia madeleine had thought it looked good on her but now the dress felt hot and sticky the fat leather belt looked like an s m restraint and there was a stain near the hem that she didn t want to identify abby meanwhile had knocked on olivia s door and entered so much for maddy s broken heart she said wake up you ve got to see this the path to the bathroom was clear madeleine s need for a shower was extreme almost medical at a minimum she had to brush her teeth but olivia s voice was audible now soon madeleine would have two roommates interrogating her her parents were liable to start ringing again any minute as quietly as possible she inched back down the hall she stepped into a pair of loafers left by the front door crushing the heels flat as she caught her balance and escaped into the outer corridor the elevator was waiting at the end of the floral runner waiting madeleine realized because she d failed to close the sliding gate when she d staggered out of the thing a few hours earlier now she shut the gate securely and pressed the button for the lobby and with a jolt the antique contraption began to descend through the building s interior gloom madeleine s building a neo romanesque castle called the narragansett that wrapped around the plunging corner of benefit street and church street had been built at the turn of the century among its surviving period details the stained glass skylight the brass wall sconces the marble lobby was the elevator made of curving metal bars like a giant birdcage the elevator miraculously still functioned but it moved slowly and as the car dropped madeleine took the opportunity to make herself more presentable she ran her hands through her hair finger combing it she polished her front teeth with her index finger she rubbed mascara crumbs from her eyes and moistened her lips with her tongue finally passing the balustrade on the second floor she checked her reflection in the small mirror attached to the rear panel one of the nice things about being twenty two or about being madeleine hanna was that three weeks of romantic anguish followed by a night of epic drinking didn t do much visible damage except for puffiness around her eyes madeleine looked like the same pretty dark haired person as usual the symmetries of her face the straight nose the katharine hepburn ish cheekbones and jawline were almost mathematical in their precision only the slight furrow in her brow gave evidence of the slightly anxious person that madeleine felt herself intrinsically to be she could see her parents waiting below they were trapped between the lobby door and the door to the street alton in a seersucker jacket phyllida in a navy suit and matching gold buckled purse for a second madeleine had an impulse to stop the elevator and leave her parents stuck in the foyer amid all the college town clutter the posters for new wave bands with names like wretched misery or the clits the pornographic egon schiele drawings by the risd kid on the second floor all the clamorous xeroxes whose subtext conveyed the message that the wholesome patriotic values of her parents generation were now on the ash heap of history replaced by a nihilistic post punk sensibility that madeleine herself didn t understand but was perfectly happy to scandalize her parents by pretending that she did before the elevator stopped in the lobby and she slid open the gate and stepped out to meet them alton was first through the door here she is he said avidly the college graduate in his net charging way he surged forward to seize her in a hug madeleine stiffened worried that she smelled of alcohol or worse of sex i don t know why you wouldn t let us see your apartment phyllida said coming up next i was looking forward to meeting abby and olivia we d love to treat them to dinner later we re not staying for dinner alton reminded her well we might that depends on maddy s schedule no that s not the plan the plan is to see maddy for breakfast and then leave after the ceremony your father and his plans phyllida said to madeleine are you wearing that dress to the ceremony i don t know madeleine said i can t get used to these shoulder pads all the young women are wearing they re so mannish it s olivia s you look pretty whacked out mad alton said big party last night not really don t you have anything of your own to wear phyllida said i ll have my robe on mummy madeleine said and to forestall further inspection headed past them through the foyer outside the sun had lost its battle with the clouds and vanished the weather looked not much better than it had all weekend campus dance on friday night had been more or less rained out the baccalaureate service on sunday had proceeded under a steady drizzle now on monday the rain had stopped but the temperature felt closer to st patrick s than to memorial day as she waited for her parents to join her on the sidewalk it occurred to madeleine that she hadn t had sex not really this was some consolation your sister sends her regrets phyllida said coming out she has to take richard the lionhearted for an ultrasound today richard the lionhearted was madeleine s nine week old nephew everyone else called him richard what s the matter with him madeleine asked one of his kidneys is petite apparently the doctors want to keep an eye on it if you ask me all these ultrasounds do is find things to worry about speaking of ultrasounds alton said i need to get one on my knee phyllida paid no attention anyway allie s devastated not to see you graduate as is blake but they re hoping you and your new beau might visit them this summer on your way to the cape you had to stay alert around phyllida here she was ostensibly talking about richard the lionhearted s petite kidney and already she d managed to move the subject to madeleine s new boyfriend leonard whom phyllida and alton hadn t met and to cape cod where madeleine had announced plans to cohabitate with him on a normal day when her brain was working madeleine would have been able to keep one step ahead of phyllida but this morning the best she could manage was to let the words float past her fortunately alton changed the subject so where do you recommend for breakfast madeleine turned and looked vaguely down benefit street there s a place this way she started shuffling along the sidewalk walking moving seemed like a good idea she led them past a line of quaint nicely maintained houses bearing historical placards and a big apartment building with a gable roof providence was a corrupt town crime ridden and mob controlled but up on college hill this was hard to see the sketchy downtown and dying or dead textile mills lay below in the grim distance here the narrow streets many of them cobblestone climbed past mansions or snaked around puritan graveyards full of headstones as narrow as heaven s door streets with names like prospect benevolent hope and meeting all of them feeding into the arboreous campus at the top the sheer physical elevation suggested an intellectual one aren t these slate sidewalks lovely phyllida said as she followed along we used to have slate sidewalks on our street they re much more attractive but then the borough replaced them with concrete assessed us for the bill too alton said he was limping slightly bringing up the rear the right leg of his charcoal trousers was swelled from the knee brace he wore on and off the tennis court alton had been club champion in his age group for twelve years running one of those older guys with a sweatband ringing a balding crown a choppy forehand and absolute murder in his eyes madeleine had been trying to beat alton her entire life without success this was even more infuriating because she was better than he was at this point but whenever she took a set from alton he started intimidating her acting mean disputing calls and her game fell apart madeleine was worried that there was something paradigmatic in this that she was destined to go through life being cowed by less capable men as a result madeleine s tennis matches against alton had assumed such outsize personal significance for her that she got tight whenever she played him with predictable results and alton still gloated when he won still got all rosy and jiggly as if he d bested her by sheer talent at the corner of benefit and waterman they crossed behind the white steeple of first baptist church in preparation for the ceremony loudspeakers had been set up on the lawn a man wearing a bow tie a dean of students looking person was tensely smoking a cigarette and inspecting a raft of balloons tied to the churchyard fence by now phyllida had caught up to madeleine taking her arm to negotiate the uneven slate which was pushed up by the roots of gnarled plane trees that lined the curb as a little girl madeleine had thought her mother pretty but that was a long time ago phyllida s face had gotten heavier over the years her cheeks were beginning to sag like those of a camel the conservative clothes she wore the clothes of a philanthropist or lady ambassador had a tendency to conceal her figure phyllida s hair was where her power resided it was expensively set into a smooth dome like a band shell for the presentation of that long running act her face for as long as madeleine could remember phyllida had never been at a loss for words or shy about a point of etiquette among her friends madeleine liked to make fun of her mother s formality but she often found herself comparing other people s manners unfavorably with phyllida s and right now phyllida was looking at madeleine with the proper expression for this moment thrilled by the pomp and ceremony eager to put intelligent questions to any of madeleine s professors she happened to meet or to trade pleasantries with fellow parents of graduating seniors in short she was available to everyone and everything and in step with the social and academic pageantry all of which exacerbated madeleine s feeling of being out of step for this day and the rest of her life she plunged on however across waterman street and up the steps of carr house seeking refuge and coffee the café had just opened the guy behind the counter who was wearing elvis costello glasses was rinsing out the espresso machine at a table against the wall a girl with stiff pink hair was smoking a clove cigarette and reading invisible cities tainted love played from the stereo on top of the refrigerator phyllida holding her handbag protectively against her chest had paused to peruse the student art on the walls six paintings of small skin diseased dogs wearing bleach bottle collars isn t this fun she said tolerantly la bohème alton said madeleine installed her parents at a table near the bay window as far away from the pink haired girl as possible and went up to the counter the guy took his time coming over she ordered three coffees a large for her and bagels while the bagels were being toasted she brought the coffees over to her parents alton who couldn t sit at the breakfast table without reading had taken a discarded village voice from a nearby table and was perusing it phyllida was staring overtly at the girl with pink hair do you think that s comfortable she inquired in a low voice madeleine turned to see that the girl s ragged black jeans were held together by a few hundred safety pins i don t know mummy why don t you go ask her i m afraid of getting poked according to this article alton said reading the voice homosexuality didn t exist until the nineteenth century it was invented in germany the coffee was hot and lifesavingly good sipping it madeleine began to feel slightly less awful after a few minutes she went up to get the bagels they were a little burned but she didn t want to wait for new ones and so brought them back to the table after examining his with a sour expression alton began scraping it punitively with a plastic knife phyllida asked so are we going to meet leonard today i m not sure madeleine said anything you want us to know about no are you two still planning to live together this summer by this time madeleine had taken a bite of her bagel and since the answer to her mother s question was complicated strictly speaking madeleine and leonard weren t planning on living together because they d broken up three weeks ago despite this fact however madeleine hadn t given up hope of a reconciliation and seeing as she d spent so much effort getting her parents used to the idea of her living with a guy and didn t want to jeopardize that by admitting that the plan was off she was relieved to be able to point at her full mouth which prevented her from replying well you re an adult now phyllida said you can do what you like though for the record i have to say that i don t approve you ve already gone on record about that alton broke in because it s still a bad idea phyllida cried i don t mean the propriety of it i m talking about the practical problems if you move in with leonard or any young man and he s the one with the job then you begin at a disadvantage what happens if you two don t get along where are you then you won t have any place to live or anything to do that her mother was correct in her analysis that the predicament phyllida warned madeleine about was exactly the predicament she was already in didn t motivate madeleine to register agreement you quit your job when you met me alton said to phyllida that s why i know what i m talking about can we change the subject madeleine said at last having swallowed her food of course we can sweetheart that s the last i ll say about it if your plans change you can always come home your father and i would love to have you not me alton said i don t want her moving back home is always a bad idea stay away don t worry madeleine said i will the choice is yours phyllida said but if you do come home you could have the loft that way you can come and go as you like to her surprise madeleine found herself contemplating this proposal why not tell her parents everything curl up in the backseat of the car and let them take her home she could move into her old bedroom with the sleigh bed and the madeline wallpaper she could become a spinster like emily dickinson writing poems full of dashes and brilliance and never gaining weight phyllida brought her out of this reverie maddy she said isn t that your friend mitchell madeleine wheeled in her seat where i think that s mitchell across the street in the churchyard sitting indian style in the freshly mown grass madeleine s friend mitchell grammaticus was indeed there his lips were moving as if he was talking to himself why don t you invite him to join us phyllida said now why not i d love to see mitchell he s probably waiting for his parents madeleine said phyllida waved despite the fact that mitchell was too far away to notice what s he doing sitting on the ground alton asked the three hannas stared across the street at mitchell in his half lotus well if you re not going to ask him i will phyllida finally said o k madeleine said fine i ll go ask him the day was getting warmer but not by much black clouds were massing in the distance as madeleine came down the steps of carr house and crossed the street into the churchyard someone inside the church was testing the loudspeakers fussily repeating sussex essex and kent sussex essex and kent a banner draped over the church entrance read class of 1982 beneath the banner in the grass was mitchell his lips were still moving silently but when he noticed madeleine approaching they abruptly stopped madeleine remained a few feet away my parents are here she informed him it s graduation mitchell replied evenly everyone s parents are here they want to say hello to you at this mitchell smiled faintly they probably don t realize you re not speaking to me no they don t madeleine said and anyway i am now speaking to you under duress or as a change of policy madeleine shifted her weight wrinkling her face unhappily look i m really hungover i barely slept last night my parents have been here about ten minutes and they re already driving me crazy so if you could just come over and say hello that would be great mitchell s large emotional eyes blinked twice he was wearing a vintage gabardine shirt dark wool pants and beat up wingtips madeleine had never seen him in shorts or tennis shoes i m sorry he said about what happened fine madeleine said looking away it doesn t matter i was just being my usual vile self so was i they were quiet a moment madeleine felt mitchell s eyes on her and she crossed her arms over her chest what had happened was this one night the previous december in a state of anxiety about her romantic life madeleine had run into mitchell on campus and brought him back to her apartment she d needed male attention and had flirted with him without entirely admitting it to herself in her bedroom mitchell had picked up a jar of deep heating gel on her desk asking what it was for madeleine had explained that people who were athletic sometimes got sore muscles she understood that mitchell might not have experienced this phenomenon seeing as all he did was sit in the library but he should take her word for it at that point mitchell had come up behind her and wiped a gob of heating gel behind her ear madeleine jumped up shouting at mitchell and wiped the gunk off with a t shirt though she was within her rights to be angry madeleine also knew even at the time that she was using the incident as a pretext for getting mitchell out of her bedroom and for covering up the fact that she d been flirting with him in the first place the worst part of the incident was how stricken mitchell had looked as if he d been about to cry he kept saying he was sorry he was just joking around but she ordered him to leave in the following days replaying the incident in her mind madeleine had felt worse and worse about it she d been on the verge of calling mitchell to apologize when she d received a letter from him a highly detailed cogently argued psychologically astute quietly hostile four page letter in which he called her a cocktease and claimed that her behavior that night had been the erotic equivalent of bread and circus with just the circus the next time they d run into each other madeleine had acted as if she didn t know him and they hadn t spoken since now in the churchyard of first baptist mitchell looked up at her and said o k let s go say hello to your parents phyllida was waving as they came up the steps in the flirtatious voice she reserved for her favorite of madeleine s friends she called out i thought that was you on the ground you looked like a swami congratulations mitchell alton said heartily shaking mitchell s hand big day today one of the milestones a new generation takes the reins they invited mitchell to sit down and asked him if he wanted anything to eat madeleine went back to the counter to get more coffee glad to have mitchell keeping her parents occupied as she watched him in his old man s clothes engaging alton and phyllida in conversation madeleine thought to herself as she d thought many times before that mitchell was the kind of smart sane parent pleasing boy she should fall in love with and marry that she would never fall in love with mitchell and marry him precisely because of this eligibility was yet another indication in a morning teeming with them of just how screwed up she was in matters of the heart when she returned to the table no one acknowledged her so mitchell phyllida was asking what are your plans after graduation my father s been asking me the same question mitchell answered for some reason he thinks religious studies isn t a marketable degree madeleine smiled for the first time all day see mitchell doesn t have a job lined up either well i sort of do mitchell said you do not madeleine challenged him i m serious i do he explained that he and his roommate larry pleshette had come up with a plan to fight the recession as liberal arts degree holders matriculating into the job market at a time when unemployment was at 9 5 percent they had decided after much consideration to leave the country and stay away as long as possible at the end of the summer after they d saved up enough money they were going to backpack through europe after they d seen everything in europe there was to see they were going to fly to india and stay there as long as their money held out the whole trip would take eight or nine months maybe as long as a year you re going to india madeleine said that s not a job we re going to be research assistants mitchell said for prof hughes prof hughes in the theater department i saw a program about india recently phyllida said it was terribly depressing the poverty that s a plus for me mrs hanna mitchell said i thrive in squalor phyllida who couldn t resist this sort of mischief gave up her solemnity rippling with amusement then you re going to the right place maybe i ll take a trip too madeleine said in a threatening tone no one reacted instead alton asked mitchell what sort of immunizations do you need for india cholera and typhus gamma globulin s optional phyllida shook her head your mother must be worried sick when i was in the service alton said they shot us up with a million things didn t even tell us what the shots were for i think i ll move to paris madeleine said in a louder voice instead of getting a job mitchell phyllida continued with your interest in religious studies i d think india would be a perfect fit they ve got everything hindus muslims sikhs zoroastrians jains buddhists it s like baskin and robbins i ve always been fascinated by religion unlike my doubting thomas husband alton winked i doubt that doubting thomas existed do you know paul moore bishop moore at the cathedral of saint john the divine phyllida said keeping mitchell s attention he s a great friend you might find it interesting to meet him we d be happy to introduce you when we re in the city i always go to services at the cathedral have you ever been there oh well how can i describe it it s simply well simply divine phyllida held a hand to her throat with the pleasure of this bon mot while mitchell obligingly even convincingly laughed speaking of religious dignitaries alton cut in did i ever tell you about the time we met the dalai lama it was at this fund raiser at the waldorf we were in the receiving line must have been three hundred people at least anyway when we finally got up to the dalai lama i asked him are you any relation to dolly parton i was mortified phyllida cried absolutely mortified daddy madeleine said you re going to be late what you should get going if you want to get a good spot alton looked at his watch we ve still got an hour it gets really crowded madeleine emphasized you should go now alton and phyllida looked at mitchell as if they trusted him to advise them under the table madeleine kicked him and he alertly responded it does get pretty crowded where s the best place to stand alton asked again addressing mitchell by the van wickle gates at the top of college street that s where we ll come through alton stood up from the table after shaking mitchell s hand he bent to kiss madeleine on the cheek we ll see you later miss baccalaureate 1982 congratulations mitchell phyllida said so nice to see you and remember when you re on your grand tour be sure to send your mother loads of letters otherwise she ll be frantic to madeleine she said you might change that dress before the march it has a visible stain with that alton and phyllida in their glaring parental actuality all seersucker and handbag cuff links and pearls crossed the beige and brick space of carr house and went out the door as though to signal their departure a new song came on joe jackson s high pitched voice swooping above a synthesized drumbeat the guy behind the counter cranked up the volume madeleine laid her head on the table her hair covering her face i m never drinking again she said famous last words you have no idea what s been going on with me how could i you haven t been speaking to me without lifting her cheek from the table madeleine said in a pitiful voice i m homeless i m graduating from college and i m a homeless person yeah sure i am madeleine insisted first i was supposed to move to new york with abby and olivia then it looked like i was moving to the cape though so i told them to get another roommate and now i m not moving to the cape and i have nowhere to go my mother wants me to move back home but i d rather kill myself i m moving back home for the summer mitchell said to detroit at least you re near new york i haven t heard back from grad school yet and it s june madeleine continued i was supposed to find out over a month ago i could call the admissions department but i don t because i m scared to find out that i ve been rejected as long as i don t know i still have hope there was a moment before mitchell spoke again you can come to india with me he said madeleine opened one eye to see through a whorl in her hair that mitchell wasn t entirely joking it s not even about grad school she said taking a deep breath she confessed leonard and i broke up it felt deeply pleasurable to say this to name her sadness and so madeleine was surprised by the coldness of mitchell s reply why are you telling me this he said she lifted her head brushing her hair out of her face i don t know you wanted to know what was the matter i didn t actually i didn t even ask i thought you might care madeleine said since you re my friend right mitchell said his voice suddenly sarcastic our wonderful friendship our friendship isn t a real friendship because it only works on your terms you set the rules madeleine if you decide you don t want to talk to me for three months we don t talk then you decide you do want to talk to me because you need me to entertain your parents and now we re talking again we re friends when you want to be friends and we re never more than friends because you don t want to be and i have to go along with that i m sorry madeleine said feeling put upon and blindsided i just don t like you that way exactly mitchell cried you re not attracted to me physically o k fine but who says i was ever attracted to you mentally madeleine reacted as if she d been slapped she was outraged hurt and defiant all at once you re such a she tried to think of the worst thing to say you re such a jerk she was hoping to remain imperious but her chest was stinging and to her dismay she burst into tears mitchell reached out to touch her arm but madeleine shook him off getting to her feet trying not to look like someone angrily weeping she went out the door and down the steps onto waterman street confronted by the festive churchyard she turned downhill toward the river she wanted to get away from campus her headache had returned her temples were throbbing and as she looked up at the storm clouds massing over downtown like more bad things to come she asked herself why everyone was being so mean to her madeleine s love troubles had begun at a time when the french theory she was reading deconstructed the very notion of love semiotics 211 was an upper level seminar taught by a former english department renegade michael zipperstein had come to brown thirty two years earlier as a new critic he d inculcated the habits of close reading and biography free interpretation into three generations of students before taking a road to damascus sabbatical in paris in 1975 where he d met roland barthes at a dinner party and been converted over cassoulet to the new faith now zipperstein taught two courses in the newly created program in semiotics studies introduction to semiotic theory in the fall and in the spring semiotics 211 hygienically bald with a seaman s mustacheless white beard zipperstein favored french fisherman s sweaters and wide wale corduroys he buried people with his reading lists in addition to all the semiotic big hitters derrida eco barthes the students in semiotics 211 had to contend with a magpie nest of reserve reading that included everything from balzac s sarrasine to issues of semiotext e to photocopied selections from e m cioran robert walser claude levi strauss peter handke and carl van vechten to get into the seminar you had to submit to a one on one interview with zipperstein during which he asked bland personal questions such as what your favorite food or dog breed was and made enigmatic warholian remarks in response this esoteric probing along with zipperstein s guru s dome and beard gave his students a sense that they d been spiritually vetted and were now for two hours on thursday afternoons at least part of a campus lit crit elite which was exactly what madeleine wanted she d become an english major for the purest and dullest of reasons because she loved to read the university s british and american literature course catalog was for madeleine what its bergdorf equivalent was for her roommates a course listing like english 274 lyly s euphues excited madeleine the way a pair of fiorucci cowboy boots did abby english 450a hawthorne and james filled madeleine with an expectation of sinful hours in bed not unlike what olivia got from wearing a lycra skirt and leather blazer to danceteria even as a girl in their house in prettybrook madeleine wandered into the library with its shelves of books rising higher than she could reach newly purchased volumes such as love story or myra breckinridgethat exuded a faintly forbidden air as well as venerable leather bound editions of fielding thackeray and dickens and the magisterial presence of all those potentially readable words stopped her in her tracks she could scan book spines for as long as an hour her cataloging of the family s holdings rivaled the dewey decimal system in its comprehensiveness madeleine knew right where everything was the shelves near the fireplace held alton s favorites biographies of american presidents and british prime ministers memoirs by warmongering secretaries of state novels about sailing or espionage by william f buckley jr phyllida s books filled the left side of the bookcases leading up to the parlor nyrb reviewed novels and essay collections as well as coffee table volumes about english gardens or chinoiserie even now at bed and breakfasts or seaside hotels a shelf full of forlorn books always cried out to madeleine she ran her fingers over their salt spotted covers she peeled apart pages made tacky by ocean air she had no sympathy for paperback thrillers and detective stories it was the abandoned hardback the jacketless 1931 dial press edition ringed with many a coffee cup that pierced madeleine s heart her friends might be calling her name on the beach the clambake already under way but madeleine would sit down on the bed and read for a little while to make the sad old book feel better she had read longfellow s hiawatha that way she d read james fenimore cooper she d read h m pulham esquire by john p marquand and yet sometimes she worried about what those musty old books were doing to her some people majored in english to prepare for law school others became journalists the smartest guy in the honors program adam vogel a child of academics was planning on getting a ph d and becoming an academic himself that left a large contingent of people majoring in english by default because they weren t left brained enough for science because history was too dry philosophy too difficult geology too petroleum oriented and math too mathematical because they weren t musical artistic financially motivated or really all that smart these people were pursuing university degrees doing something no different from what they d done in first grade reading stories english was what people who didn t know what to major in majored in her junior year madeleine had taken an honors seminar called the marriage plot selected novels of austen eliot and james the class was taught by k mccall saunders saunders was a seventy nine year old new englander he had a long horsey face and a moist laugh that exposed his gaudy dental work his pedagogical method consisted of his reading aloud lectures he d written twenty or thirty years earlier madeleine stayed in the class because she felt sorry for professor saunders and because the reading list was so good in saunders s opinion the novel had reached its apogee with the marriage plot and had never recovered from its disappearance in the days when success in life had depended on marriage and marriage had depended on money novelists had had a subject to write about the great epics sang of war the novel of marriage sexual equality good for women had been bad for the novel and divorce had undone it completely what would it matter whom emma married if she could file for separation later how would isabel archer s marriage to gilbert osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup as far as saunders was concerned marriage didn t mean much anymore and neither did the novel where could you find the marriage plot nowadays you couldn t you had to read historical fiction you had to read non western novels involving traditional societies afghani novels indian novels you had to go literarily speaking back in time madeleine s final paper for the seminar was titled the interrogative mood marriage proposals and the strictly limited sphere of the feminine it had impressed saunders so much that he d asked madeleine to come see him in his office which had a grandparental smell he expressed his opinion that madeleine might expand her paper into a senior honors thesis along with his willingness to serve as her advisor madeleine smiled politely professor saunders specialized in the periods she was interested in the regency leading into the victorian era he was sweet and learned and it was clear from his unsubscribed office hours that no one else wanted him as an advisor and so madeleine had said yes she would love to work with him on her senior thesis she used a line from trollope s barchester towers as an epigraph there is no happiness in love except at the end of an english novel her plan was to begin with jane austen after a brief examination of pride and prejudice persuasion and sense and sensibility all comedies essentially that ended with weddings madeleine was going to move on to the victorian novel where things got more complicated and considerably darker middlemarch and the portrait of a lady didn t end with weddings they began with the traditional moves of the marriage plot the suitors the proposals the misunderstandings but after the wedding ceremony they kept on going these novels followed their spirited intelligent heroines dorothea brooke and isabel archer into their disappointing married lives and it was here that the marriage plot reached its greatest artistic expression by 1900 the marriage plot was no more madeleine planned to end with a brief discussion of its demise in sister carrie dreiser had carrie live adulterously with drouet marry hurstwood in an invalid ceremony and then run off to become an actress and this was only in 1900 for a conclusion madeleine thought she might cite the wife swapping in updike that was the last vestige of the marriage plot the persistence in calling it wife swapping instead of husband swapping as if the woman were still a piece of property to be passed around professor saunders suggested that madeleine look at historical sources she d obediently boned up on the rise of industrialism and the nuclear family the formation of the middle class and the matrimonial causes act of 1857 but it wasn t long before she d become bored with the thesis doubts about the originality of her work nagged at her she felt as if she was regurgitating the arguments saunders had made in his marriage plot seminar her meetings with the old professor were dispiriting consisting of saunders shuffling the pages she d given him pointing out various red marks he d made in the margins then one sunday morning before winter break abby s boyfriend whitney materialized at their kitchen table reading something called of grammatology when madeleine asked what the book was about she was given to understand by whitney that the idea of a book being about something was exactly what this book was against and that if it was about anything then it was about the need to stop thinking of books as being about things madeleine said she was going to make coffee whitney asked if she would make him some too college wasn t like the real world in the real world people dropped names based on their renown in college people dropped names based on their obscurity thus in the weeks after this exchange with whitney madeleine began hearing people saying derrida she heard them saying lyotard and foucault and deleuze and baudrillard that most of these people were those she instinctually disapproved of upper middle class kids who wore doc martens and anarchist symbols made madeleine dubious about the value of their enthusiasm but soon she noticed david koppel a smart and talented poet also reading derrida and pookie ames who read slush for the paris review and whom madeleine liked was taking a course with professor zipperstein madeleine had always been partial to grandiose professors people like sears jayne who hammed it up in the classroom reciting hart crane or anne sexton in a gag voice whitney acted as though professor jayne was a joke madeleine didn t agree but after three solid years of taking literature courses madeleine had nothing like a firm critical methodology to apply to what she read instead she had a fuzzy unsystematic way of talking about books it embarrassed her to hear the things people said in class and the things she said i felt that it was interesting the way proust i liked the way faulkner and when olivia who was tall and slim with a long aristocratic nose like a saluki came in one day carrying of grammatology madeleine knew that what had been marginal was now mainstream what s that book like you haven t read it would i be asking if i had olivia sniffed aren t we a little bitchy today sorry just kidding it s great derrida is my absolute god almost overnight it became laughable to read writers like cheever or updike who wrote about the suburbia madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in in favor of reading the marquis de sade who wrote about anally deflowering virgins in eighteenth century france the reason de sade was preferable was that his shocking sex scenes weren t about sex but politics they were therefore anti imperialist anti bourgeois anti patriarchal and anti everything a smart young feminist should be against right up through her third year at college madeleine kept wholesomely taking courses like victorian fantasy from phantastes to the water babies but by senior year she could no longer ignore the contrast between the hard up blinky people in her beowulf seminar and the hipsters down the hall reading maurice blanchot going to college in the moneymaking eighties lacked a certain radicalism semiotics was the first thing that smacked of revolution it drew a line it created an elect it was sophisticated and continental it dealt with provocative subjects with torture sadism hermaphroditism with sex and power madeleine had always been popular at school years of being popular had left her with the reflexive ability to separate the cool from the uncool even within subgroups like the english department where the concept of cool didn t appear to obtain if restoration drama was getting you down if scanning wordsworth was making you feel dowdy and ink stained there was another option you could flee k mccall saunders and the old new criticism you could defect to the new imperium of derrida and eco you could sign up for semiotics 211 and find out what everyone else was talking about semiotics 211 was limited to ten students of the ten eight had taken introduction to semiotic theory this was visually apparent at the first class meeting lounging around the seminar table when madeleine came into the room from the wintry weather outside were eight people in black t shirts and ripped black jeans a few had razored off the necks or sleeves of their t shirts there was something creepy about one guy s face it was like a baby s face that had grown whiskers and it took madeleine a full minute to realize that he d shaved off his eyebrows everyone in the room was so spectral looking that madeleine s natural healthiness seemed suspect like a vote for reagan she was relieved therefore when a big guy in a down jacket and snowmobile boots showed up and took the empty seat next to her he had a cup of take out coffee zipperstein asked the students to introduce themselves and explain why they were taking the seminar the boy without eyebrows spoke up first um let s see i m finding it hard to introduce myself actually because the whole idea of social introductions is so problematized like if i tell you that my name is thurston meems and that i grew up in stamford connecticut will you know who i am o k my name s thurston and i m from stamford connecticut i m taking this course because i read of grammatology last summer and it blew my mind when it was the turn of the boy next to madeleine he said in a quiet voice that he was a double major biology and philosophy and had never taken a semiotics course before that his parents had named him leonard that it had always seemed pretty handy to have a name especially when you were being called to dinner and that if anyone wanted to call him leonard he would answer to it leonard didn t make another comment during the rest of the class he leaned back in his chair stretching out his long legs after he finished his coffee he dug into his right snowmobile boot and to madeleine s surprise pulled out a tin of chewing tobacco with two stained fingers he placed a wad of tobacco in his cheek for the next two hours every minute or so he spat discreetly but audibly into the cup every week zipperstein assigned one daunting book of theory and one literary selection the pairings were eccentric if not downright arbitrary what did saussure s writings in general linguistics for instance have to do with pynchon s the crying of lot 49 as for zipperstein himself he didn t run the class so much as observe it from behind the one way mirror of his opaque personality he hardly said a word he asked questions now and then to stimulate discussion and often went to the window to gaze in the direction of narragansett bay as if thinking about his wooden sloop in dry dock three weeks into the course on a february day of flurries and gray skies they read zipperstein s own book the making of signs along with peter handke s a sorrow beyond dreams it was always embarrassing when professors assigned their own books even madeleine who found all the reading hard going could tell that zipperstein s contribution to the field was reformulative and second tier everyone seemed a little hesitant when talking about the making of signs so it was a relief when after the break they turned to the literary selection so zipperstein asked blinking behind his round wire rims what did you make of the handke after a short silence thurston spoke up the handke was totally dank and depressing he said i loved it thurston was a sly looking boy with short gelled hair his eyebrowlessness along with his pale complexion gave his face a superintelligent quality like a floating disembodied brain care to elaborate zipperstein said well professor here s a subject dear to my heart offing yourself the other students tittered as thurston warmed to his topic it s purportedly autobiographical this book but i d contend with barthes that the act of writing is itself a fictionalization even if you re treating actual events bart so that was how you pronounced it madeleine made a note grateful to be spared humiliation meanwhile thurston was saying so handke s mother commits suicide and handke sits down to write about it he wants to be as objective as possible to be totally remorseless thurston stifled a smile he aspired to be a person who would react to his own mother s suicide with high literary remorselessness and his soft young face lit up with pleasure suicide is a trope he announced especially in german literature you ve got the sorrows of young werther you ve got kleist hey i just thought of something he held up a finger the sorrows of young werther he held up another finger a sorrow beyond dreams my theory is that handke felt the weight of all that tradition and this book was his attempt to break free how do you mean free zipperstein said from the whole teutonic sturm und drang suicidal thing the flurries swirling outside the windows looked like either flakes of soap or flash of ash like something either very clean or very dirty the sorrows of young werther is an apt reference zipperstein said but i think that s more the translator s doing than handke s in german the book s called wunschloses unglück thurston smiled either because he was pleased to be receiving zipperstein s full attention or because he thought german sounded funny it s a play on a german saying wunschlos glücklich which means being happier than you could ever wish for only here handke makes a nice reversal it s a serious and strangely wonderful title so it means being unhappier than you could ever wish for madeleine said zipperstein looked at her for the first time in a sense as i said something is lost in translation what was your take on the book madeleine asked and immediately realized how stupid this sounded she fell silent the blood beating in her ears people blushed in nineteenth century english novels but never in contemporary austrian ones before the silence became uncomfortable leonard came to her rescue i have a comment he said if i was going to write about my mother s suicide i don t think i d be too concerned about being experimental he leaned forward putting his elbows on the table i mean wasn t anybody put off by handke s so called remorselessness didn t this book strike anyone as a tad cold better cold than sentimental thurston said do you think why because we ve read the sentimental filial account of a cherished dead parent before we ve read it a million times it doesn t have any power anymore i m doing a little thought experiment here leonard said say my mother killed herself and say i wrote a book about it why would i want to do something like that he closed his eyes and leaned his head back first i d do it to cope with my grief second maybe to paint a portrait of my mother to keep her alive in my memory and you think your reaction is universal thurston said that because you d respond to the death of a parent a certain way that obligates handke to do the same i m saying that if your mother kills herself it s not a literary trope madeleine s heart had quieted now she was listening to the discussion with interest thurston was nodding his head in a way that somehow didn t suggest agreement yeah o k he said handke s real mother killed herself she died in a real world and handke felt real grief or whatever but that s not what this book s about books aren t about real life books are about other books he raised his mouth like a wind instrument and blew out bright notes my theory is that the problem handke was trying to solve here from a literary standpoint was how do you write about something even something real and painful like suicide when all of the writing that s been done on that subject has robbed you of any originality of expression what thurston was saying seemed to madeleine both insightful and horribly wrong it was maybe true what he said but it shouldn t have been popular literature zipperstein quipped proposing an essay title or how to beat a dead horse a spasm of mirth traveled through the class madeleine looked over to see that leonard was staring at her when the class ended he gathered up his books and left she started seeing leonard around after that she saw him crossing the green one afternoon hatless in winter drizzle she saw him at mutt geoff s eating a messy buddy cianci sandwich she saw him one morning waiting for a bus on south main each time leonard was alone looking forlorn and uncombed like a great big motherless boy at the same time he appeared somehow older than most guys at school it was madeleine s last semester of senior year a time when she was supposed to have some fun and she wasn t having any she d never thought of herself as hard up she preferred to think of her current boyfriendless state as salutary and head clearing but when she found herself wondering what it would be like to kiss a guy who chewed tobacco she began to worry that she was fooling herself looking back madeleine realized that her college love life had fallen short of expectations her freshman roommate jennifer boomgaard had rushed off to health services the first week of school to be fitted for a diaphragm unaccustomed to sharing a room with anybody much less a stranger madeleine felt that jenny was a little too quick with her intimacies she didn t want to be shown jennifer s diaphragm which reminded her of an uncooked ravioli and she certainly didn t want to feel the spermicidal jelly that jenny offered to squirt into her palm madeleine was shocked when jennifer started going to parties with the diaphragm already in place when she wore it to the harvard brown game and when she left it one morning on top of their miniature fridge that winter when the rev desmond tutu came to campus for an anti apartheid rally madeleine asked jennifer on their way to see the great cleric did you put your diaphragm in they lived the next four months in an eighteen by fifteen room without speaking to each other though madeleine hadn t arrived at college sexually inexperienced her freshman learning curve resembled a flat line aside from one make out session with a uruguayan named carlos a sandal wearing engineering student who in low light looked like che guevara the only boy she d fooled around with was a high school senior visiting campus for early action weekend she found tim standing in line at the ratty pushing his cafeteria tray along the metal track and visibly quivering his blue blazer was too big for him he d spent the entire day wandering around campus with no one speaking to him now he was starving and wasn t sure if he was allowed to eat in the cafeteria or not tim seemed to be the only person at brown more lost than madeleine she helped him negotiate the ratty and afterward took him on a tour of the university finally around ten thirty that night they ended up back in madeleine s dorm room tim had the long lashed eyes and pretty features of an expensive bavarian doll a little prince or yodeling shepherd boy his blue blazer was on the floor and madeleine s shirt unbuttoned when jennifer boomgaard came through the door oh she said sorry and proceeded to stand there smiling at the floor as if already relishing how this juicy bit of gossip would play along the hall when she finally did leave madeleine sat up and readjusted her clothes and tim picked up his blazer and went back to high school at christmas when madeleine went home for vacation she thought the scale in her parents bathroom was broken she got off to recalibrate the dial and got back on whereupon the scale again registered the same weight stepping in front of the mirror madeleine encountered a worried chipmunk staring back am i not getting asked out because i m fat the chipmunk said or am i fat because i m not getting asked out i never got the freshman fifteen her sister gloated when madeleine came down to breakfast but i didn t pig out like all my friends did accustomed to alwyn s teasing madeleine paid no attention quietly slicing and eating the first of the fifty seven grapefruits she subsisted on until new year s dieting fooled you into thinking you could control your life by january madeleine was down five pounds and by the time squash season ended she was back in great shape and still she didn t meet anyone she liked the boys at college seemed either incredibly immature or prematurely middle aged bearded like therapists warming brandy snifters over candles while listening to coltrane s a love supreme it wasn t until her junior year that madeleine had a serious boyfriend billy bainbridge was the son of dorothy bainbridge whose uncle owned a third of the newspapers in the united states billy had flushed cheeks blond curls and a scar on his right temple that made him even more adorable than he already was he was soft spoken and nice smelling like ivory soap naked his body was nearly hairless billy didn t like to talk about his family madeleine took this as a sign of good breeding billy was a legacy at brown and sometimes worried that he wouldn t have gotten in on his own sex with billy was cozy it was snuggly it was perfectly fine he wanted to be a filmmaker the one film he made for advanced filmmaking however was a violent unbroken twelve minutes of billy throwing fecal looking brownie mix at the camera madeleine began to wonder if there was a reason he never talked about his family one thing he did talk about however with increasing intensity was circumcision billy had read an article in an alternative health magazine that argued against the practice and it made a big impression on him if you think about it it s a pretty weird thing to do to a baby he said cut off part of its dick what s so different about a tribe in like papua new guinea putting bones through their noses and cutting off a baby s foreskin a bone through the nose is a lot less invasive madeleine listened trying to look sympathetic and hoped billy would drop the subject but as the weeks passed he kept returning to it the doctors just do it automatically in this country he said they didn t ask my parents it s not like i m jewish or anything he derided justifications on the basis of health or hygiene maybe that made sense three thousand years ago out in the desert when you couldn t take a shower but now one night as they were lying in bed naked madeleine noticed billy examining his penis stretching it what are you doing she asked i m looking for the scar he said somberly he interrogated his european friends henrik the intact olivier the foreskinned asking but does it feel supersensitive billy was convinced that he d been deprived of sensation madeleine tried not to take this personally plus there were other problems with their relationship by then billy had a habit of staring deeply into madeleine s eyes in a way that was somehow controlling his roommate situation was odd he lived off campus with an attractive muscular girl named kyle who was sleeping with at least three people including fatima shirazi a niece of the shah of iran on the wall of his living room billy had painted the words kill the father killing the father was what in billy s opinion college was all about who s your father he asked madeleine is it virginia woolf is it sontag in my case madeleine said my father really is my father then you have to kill him who s your father godard he said billy talked about renting a house in guanajuato with madeleine over the summer he said she could write a novel while he made a film his faith in her in her writing even though she hardly wrote any fiction made madeleine feel so good that she started going along with the idea and then one day she came up onto billy s front porch and was about to rap on his window when something told her to look in the window instead in the storm tossed bed billy lay curled john lennon style against the spread eagled kyle both were naked a second later in a puff of smoke fatima materialized also naked shaking baby powder over her gleaming persian skin she smiled at her bedmates her teeth seed like in purple royal gums maddy s next boyfriend wasn t strictly her fault she would never have met dabney carlisle if she hadn t taken an acting class and she would never have taken an acting class if it hadn t been for her mother as a young woman phyllida had wanted to be an actress her parents had been opposed however acting wasn t what people in our family especially the ladies did was the way phyllida put it every so often in reflective moods she told her daughters the story of her one great disobedience after graduating from college phyllida had run away to hollywood without telling her parents she d flown out to los angeles staying with a friend from smith she d found a job as a secretary in an insurance company she and the friend a girl named sally peyton moved into a bungalow in santa monica in six months phyllida had three auditions one screen test and loads of invitations she d once seen jackie gleason carrying a chihuahua into a restaurant she d developed a lustrous suntan she described as egyptian whenever phyllida spoke about this period in her life it seemed as if she was talking about another person as for alton he became quiet fully aware that phyllida s loss had been his gain it was on the train back to new york the next christmas that she d met the straight backed lieutenant colonel recently returned from berlin phyllida never went back to l a she got married instead and had you two she told her daughters phyllida s inability to realize her dreams had given madeleine her own her mother s life was the great counterexample it represented the injustice madeleine s life would rectify to come of age simultaneously with a great social movement to grow up in the age of betty friedan and era marches and bella abzug s indomitable hats to define your identity when it was being redefined this was a freedom as great as any of the american freedoms madeleine had read about in school she could remember the night in 1973 when her family gathered before the television in the den to watch the tennis match between billie jean king and bobby riggs how she alwyn and phyllida had rooted for billie jean while alton had pulled for bobby riggs how as king ran riggs back and forth across the court outserving him hitting winners he was too slow to return alton began to grumble it s not a fair fight riggs is too old if they want a real test she should play smith or newcombe but it didn t matter what alton said it didn t matter that bobby riggs was fifty five and king twenty nine or that riggs hadn t been an especially great player even in his prime what mattered was that this tennis match was on national television during prime time billed for weeks as the battle of the sexes and that the woman was winning if any single moment defined madeleine s generation of girls dramatized their aspirations put into clear focus what they expected from themselves and from life it was those two hours and fifteen minutes when the country watched a man in white shorts get thrashed by a woman pummeled repeatedly until all he could do after match point was to jump feebly over the net and even that was telling you were supposed to jump the net when you won not lost so how male was that to act like a winner when you d just been creamed at the first meeting of acting workshop professor churchill a bald bullfrog of a man asked the students to say something about themselves half the people in the class were theater majors serious about acting or directing madeleine mumbled something about loving shakespeare and eugene o neill dabney carlisle stood up and said i ve done a little modeling work down in new york my agent suggested i should take some acting lessons so here i am the modeling he d done consisted of a single magazine ad showing a group of leni riefenstahl ish athletes in boxer briefs standing in a receding line on a beach whose black volcanic sand steamed around their marble feet madeleine didn t see the photograph until she and dabney were already going out when dabney gingerly took it out of the bartending manual where he kept it safely pressed she was inclined to make fun of it but something reverential in dabney s expression stopped her and so she asked where the beach had been montauk and why it was so black it wasn t and how much he d gotten paid four figures and what the other guys were like total a holes and if he was wearing the underpants right now it was sometimes difficult with boys to take an interest in the things that interested them but with dabney she wished it had been curling she longed for it to be the model un anything but male modeling this anyway was the authentic emotion she now identified herself as having felt at the time dabney cautioned her against touching the ad before he got it laminated madeleine had rehearsed in her mind the standard arguments that though objectification was de facto bad the emergence of the idealized male form in the mass media scored a point for equality that if men started getting objectified and started worrying about their looks and their bodies they might begin to understand the burden women had been living with since forever and might therefore be sensitized to these issues of the body she even went so far as to admire dabney for his courage in allowing himself to be photographed in snug little gray underpants looking the way madeleine and dabney did it was inevitable that they would be cast as romantic leads in the scenes the workshop performed madeleine was rosalind to dabney s wooden orlando maggie to his brick like brick in cat on a hot tin roof to rehearse the first time they met at dabney s fraternity house merely stepping through the front door reinforced madeleine s aversion to places like sigma chi it was around ten on a sunday morning the vestiges of the previous evening s hawaiian night were still there to see the lei hanging from the antlers of the moose head on the wall the plastic grass skirt trampled on the beer sodden floor a skirt that should madeleine succumb to the outrageous good looks of dabney carlisle she might at a minimum have to watch some drunken slut hula in to the baying of the brothers or at a maximum for mai tais made you do crazy things might even don herself up in dabney s room for his pleasure alone on the low slung couch two sigma chi members were watching tv at madeleine s appearance they stirred rising out of the gloom like openmouthed carp she hurried to the back stairs thinking the things she always thought when it came to frats and frat guys that their appeal stemmed from a primitive need for protection one thought of neanderthal clans banding together against other neanderthal clans that the hazing the pledges underwent being stripped and blindfolded and left in the lobby of the biltmore hotel with bus fare taped to their genitals enacted the very fears of male rape and emasculation that membership in the fraternity promised protection against that any guy who longed to join a frat suffered from insecurities that poisoned his relationships with women that there was something seriously wrong with homophobic guys who centered their lives around a homoerotic bond that the stately mansions maintained by generations of dues paying fraternity members were in reality sites for date rape and problem drinking that frats always smelled bad that you didn t ever want to shower in one that only freshman girls were stupid enough to go to frat parties that kelly traub had slept with a sigma delt guy who kept saying now you see it now you don t now you see it now you don t that such a thing wasn t going to happen to her to madeleine ever what she hadn t expected when it came to a fraternity was a sunny haired silent type like dabney learning his lines in a folding chair in parachute pants shoeless looking back on their relationship madeleine figured she d had no choice dabney and she had been selected for each other in a royal wedding kind of way she was prince charles to his princess di she knew he couldn t act dabney had the artistic soul of a third string tight end in life dabney moved and said little onstage he moved not at all but had to say a lot his best dramatic moments came when the strain on his face from remembering his lines resembled the emotion he was trying to simulate acting opposite dabney made madeleine more stiff and nervous than she already was she wanted to do scenes with the talented kids in the workshop she suggested interesting bits from the vietnamization of new jersey and mamet s sexual perversity in chicago but got no takers nobody wanted to lower his or her average by acting with her dabney didn t let it bother him bunch of little shits in that class he said they ll never get any print work much less movies he was more laconic than she liked her boyfriends to be he had the wit of a store mannequin but dabney s physical perfection pushed these realities out of her mind she d never been in a relationship where she wasn t the more attractive partner it was slightly intimidating but she could handle it at three a m while dabney lay sleeping beside her madeleine found she was up to the task of inventorying each abdominal cord every hard lump of muscle she enjoyed applying calipers to dabney s waist to measure his body fat underwear modeling was all about the abs dabney said and the abs were all about sit ups and diet the pleasure madeleine got from looking at dabney was reminiscent of the pleasure she d gotten as a girl from looking at sleek hunting dogs underneath this pleasure like the coals that fed it was a fierce need to enfold dabney and siphon off his strength and beauty it was all very primitive and evolutionary and felt fantastic the problem was that she hadn t been able to allow herself to enjoy dabney or even to exploit him a little but had had to go and be a total girl about it and convince herself that she was in love with him madeleine required emotion apparently she disapproved of the idea of meaningless extremely satisfying sex and so she began to tell herself that dabney s acting was restrained or economical she appreciated that dabney was secure about himself and didn t need to prove anything and wasn t a showoff instead of worrying that he was dull madeleine decided he was gentle instead of thinking he was poorly read she called him intuitive she exaggerated dabney s mental abilities in order not to feel shallow for wanting his body to this end she helped dabney write o k she wrote english and anthro papers for him and when he got a s felt confirmed of his intelligence she sent him off to modeling auditions in new york with good luck kisses and listened to him complain bitterly about the faggots who hadn t hired his services it turned out that dabney wasn t so beautiful among the truly beautiful he was only so so he couldn t even smile right at the end of the semester the acting students met separately with the professor for a critical review churchill welcomed madeleine with a wolfish yellow grin then sat back jowly and deliberate in his chair i ve enjoyed having you in the class madeleine he said but you can t act don t hold back madeleine said chastened but laughing give it to me straight you have a good feel for language for shakespeare especially but your voice is reedy and you look worried onstage your forehead has a perpetual crease a vocal coach could go a long way toward helping your instrument but i worry about your worrying you ve got it right now the crease it s called thinking which is fine if you re playing eleanor roosevelt or golda meir but those parts don t come around very often churchill steepling his fingers continued i d be more diplomatic if i thought this meant a lot to you but i get the feeling you don t want to be a professional actress do you no madeleine said good you re lovely you re bright the world is your oyster go with my blessings when dabney returned from his review with churchill he looked even more self contented than usual so madeleine asked how did it go he says i m perfect for soaps soap commercials dabney looked peeved days of our lives general hospital ever heard of those did he mean that as a compliment how else could he mean it soap actors have it made they work every day make great money and never have to travel i ve been wasting my time trying to get all this advertising work screw that i m going to tell my agent to start lining up some auditions for soaps madeleine was silent at this news she d assumed dabney s enthusiasm for modeling was temporary a tuition earning scheme now she realized he was in earnest she was in fact dating a model what are you thinking dabney asked her nothing tell me just that i don t know but i doubt prof churchill has that high of an opinion of the acting on days of our lives what did he tell us the first class he said he was giving a workshop in acting for people who wanted to work in the theater in the theater doesn t mean what did he tellyou did he say you were going to be a movie star he told me i couldn t act madeleine said he did huh dabney put his hands in his pockets leaning back on his heels as if relieved not to have to deliver this verdict himself is that why you re so pissed off and have to tear down my crit i m not tearing down your crit i m just not sure you got churchill s meaning exactly dabney let out a bitter laugh i wouldn t get it right would i i m too dumb i m just some dumb jock you have to write english papers for i don t know you seem to have a pretty good grasp of sarcasm man am i ever lucky dabney said what would i do if you weren t around you have to catch all the subtleties for me don t you you and your flair for catching subtleties it must be nice to be rich and sit around all day catching subtleties what do you know about needing to make a living it s fine for you to make fun of my ad you didn t get into college on a football scholarship and now you have to come in here and run me down you know what this is bullshit this is total bullshit i m sick of your condescension and your superiority complex and churchill s right you can t act in the end madeleine had to admit that dabney was far more fluent than she d ever expected he was capable of portraying a range of emotions too anger disgust wounded pride and of simulating others including affection passion and love he had a great career in the soaps ahead of him madeleine and dabney had broken up in may right before summer and there was no better time than summer to forget about somebody she d gone straight down to prettybrook the day she finished her last exam for once she was glad to have such sociable parents with all the cocktail parties and convivial dinners on wilson lane there was little time to dwell on herself in july she got an internship at a nonprofit poetry organization on the upper east side and began riding the train into the city madeleine s job was to oversee submissions for the annual new voices award which involved making sure that the submissions were complete before sending them off to the judge howard nemerov that year madeleine wasn t particularly technical but because everyone else in the office was even less so she ended up being the go to person whenever the copier or the dot matrix printer malfunctioned her coworker brenda would come up to madeleine s desk at least once a week and ask in a babyish voice can you help me the printer s not being nice the only part of the day madeleine enjoyed was her lunch hour when she got to walk around the muggy stinking thrilling streets eat quiche in a french bistro as narrow as a bowling alley and stare at the styles women her age or a little older were wearing when the one straight guy at the nonprofit asked her to have a drink after work madeleine cooly answered sorry i can t trying not to feel bad about hurting his feelings trying to think about her own feelings for a change she arrived back at college for her senior year then intent on being studious career oriented and aggressively celibate casting a wide net madeleine sent away for applications to yale grad school english language and literature an organization for teaching english in china and an advertising internship at foote cone belding in chicago she studied for the gre using a sample booklet the verbal section was easy the math required brushing up on her high school algebra the logic problems however were a defeat to the spirit at the annual dancers ball a number of dancers performed their favorite dance with their favorite partners alan danced the tango while becky watched the waltz james and charlotte were fantastic together keith was magnificent during his foxtrot and simon excelled at the rumba jessica danced with alan but laura did not dance with simon can you determine who danced with whom and which dance they each enjoyed logic wasn t something madeleine had been expressly taught it seemed unfair to be asked about it she did as the book suggested diagramming the problems placing alan becky james charlotte keith simon jessica and laura on the dance floor of her scrap paper and pairing them according to the instructions but their complicated transit wasn t a subject madeleine s mind naturally followed she wanted to know why james and charlotte were fantastic together and if jessica and alan were going out and why laura wouldn t dance with simon and if becky was upset watching one afternoon on the bulletin board outside hillel house madeleine noticed a flyer announcing the melvin and hetty greenberg fellowship for summer study at hebrew university in jerusalem and she applied for that using contacts of alton s in the publishing world she put on a business suit and went down to new york for an informational interview with an editor at simon and schuster the editor terry wirth had once been a bright idealistic english major just like madeleine but she found him that afternoon in his tiny manuscript piled office looking onto the gloomy canyon of sixth avenue a middle aged father of two with a salary far below the median of his former classmates and a nasty hour and fifteen minute commute to his split level in montclair new jersey on the prospects of a book he was publishing that month the memoir of a migrant farmer wirth said now s the calm before the calm he gave madeleine a stack of manuscripts from the slush pile to critique offering to pay her fifty bucks a pop instead of reading the manuscripts madeleine took the subway down to the east village after buying a bag of pignoli cookies at de robertis she plunged into a hair salon where on a whim she allowed a butch woman with a short rat tailed haircut to go to work on her cut it close on the sides higher on top madeleine said you sure the woman said i m sure madeleine answered to show her resolve she took off her glasses forty five minutes later she put her glasses back on horror struck and elated at the transformation her head was really quite enormous she had never fathomed its true size she looked like annie lennox or david bowie like someone the hairdresser might be dating the annie lennox look was o k however androgyny was just the thing once she was back at school madeleine s haircut proclaimed her serious frame of mind and by the end of the year when her bangs had grown out to a maddening length she didn t know what to do with she remained firm in her renunciations her only slip up had been the night in her bedroom with mitchell but nothing had happened madeleine had her thesis to write she had her future to figure out the last thing she needed was a boy to distract her from her work and disturb her equilibrium but then during spring semester she met leonard bankhead and her resolve went out the window he shaved irregularly his skoal had a menthol scent cleaner more pleasant than madeleine expected whenever she looked up to find leonard staring at her with his st bernard s eyes the eyes of a drooler maybe but also of a loyal brute who could dig you out of an avalanche madeleine couldn t help staring back a significant moment longer one evening in early march when she went to the rockefeller library to pick up the reserve reading for semiotics 211 she found leonard there as well he was leaning against the counter speaking animatedly to the girl on duty who was unfortunately rather cute in a busty bettie page way think about it though leonard was saying to the girl think about it from the point of view of the fly o k i m a fly the girl said with a throaty laugh we move in slow motion to them they can see the swatter coming from a million miles away the flies are like wake me when the swatter gets close noticing madeleine the girl told leonard just a sec madeleine held out her call order slip and the girl took it and went off into the stacks picking up the balzac leonard said yes balzac to the rescue normally madeleine would have had many things to say to this many comments about balzac to make but her mind was a blank she didn t even remember to smile until he d looked away bettie page came back with madeleine s order sliding it toward her and immediately turning back to leonard he seemed different than he did in class more exuberant supercharged he raised his eyebrows in a crazed jack nicholson way and said my house fly theory is related to my theory about why time seems to go faster as you get older why s that the girl asked it s proportional leonard explained when you re five you ve only been alive a couple thousand days but by the time you re fifty you ve lived around twenty thousand days so a day when you re five seems longer because it s a greater percentage of the whole yeah sure the girl teased that follows but madeleine had understood that makes sense she said i always wondered why that was it s just a theory leonard said bettie page tapped leonard s hand to get his attention flies aren t always so fast she said i ve caught flies in my bare hands before especially in winter leonard said that s probably the kind of fly i d be one of those knucklehead winter flies there was no good excuse for madeleine to hang around the reserve reading room and so she put the balzac into her bag and headed out she began to dress differently on the days she had semiotics she took out her diamond studs leaving her ears bare she stood in front of the mirror wondering if her annie hall glasses might possibly project a new wave look she decided not and wore her contacts she unearthed a pair of beatle boots she d bought at a church basement sale in vinalhaven she put up her collar and wore more black in week four zipperstein assigned umberto eco s the role of the reader it hadn t done much for madeleine she wasn t all that interested as a reader in the reader she was still partial to that increasingly eclipsed entity the writer madeleine had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children often bullied or overlooked and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature they wanted to demote the author they wanted a book that hard won transcendent thing to be a text contingent indeterminate and open for suggestions they wanted the reader to be the main thing because they were readers whereas madeleine was perfectly happy with the idea of genius she wanted a book to take her places she couldn t get to herself she thought a writer should work harder writing a book than she did reading it when it came to letters and literature madeleine championed a virtue that had fallen out of esteem namely clarity the week after they read eco they read portions of derrida s writing and difference the week after that they read jonathan culler s on deconstruction and madeleine came to class ready to contribute to the discussion for the first time before she could do so however thurston beat her to it the culler was passable at best thurston said what didn t you like about it the professor asked him thurston had his knee up against the edge of the seminar table he pushed his chair up on its back legs scrunching up his face it s readable and everything he said and well argued and all that but it s just a question of whether you can use a discredited discourse like say reason to explicate something as paradigmatically revolutionary as deconstruction madeleine searched along the table for mutual eye rolling but the other students seemed eager to hear what thurston had to say care to elaborate zipperstein said well what i mean is first off reason is just a discourse like any other right it s only been imbued with a sense of absolute truth because it s the privileged discourse of the west what derrida s saying is that you have to use reason because you know reason is all there is but at the same time you have to be aware that language is by its very nature unreasonable you have to reason yourself out of reasonableness he pulled up the sleeve of his t shirt and scratched his bony shoulder culler on the other hand is still operating in the old mode mono as opposed to stereo so from that point of view i found the book yeah a little bit disappointing a silence ensued and deepened i don t know madeleine said glancing at leonard for support maybe it s just me but wasn t it a relief to read a logical argument for once culler boils down everything eco and derrida are saying into a digestible form thurston turned his head slowly to gaze across the seminar table at her i m not saying it s bad he said it s fine but culler s work is of a different order than derrida every genius needs an explainer that s what culler is for derrida madeleine shrugged this off i got a lot better idea of what deconstruction is from reading culler than from reading derrida thurston took pains to give her point of view full consideration it s the nature of a simplification to be simple he said class ended shortly after that leaving madeleine fuming as she was coming out of sayles hall she saw leonard standing on the steps holding a coke can she went right up to him and said thanks for the help excuse me i thought you were on my side why didn t you say anything in class first law of thermodynamics leonard said conservation of energy didn t you agree with me i did and i didn t leonard said you didn t like the culler the culler s good but derrida s a heavyweight you can t just write him off madeleine looked dubious but derrida wasn t who she was mad at considering how thurston s always going on about how much he worships language you d think he wouldn t parrot so much jargon he used the word phallus three times today leonard smiled figures if he says it it ll be like having one he drives me crazy you want to get some coffee and fascist that s another of his favorites you know the dry cleaners on thayer street he called them fascist must have gone extra heavy on the starch yes madeleine said yes what you just invited me for coffee i did leonard said yes i did o k let s go get coffee leonard didn t want to go to the blue room he said he didn t like to be around college students they headed through wayland arch up to hope street in the direction of fox point as they walked leonard spat into his coke can every so often pardon my disgusting habit he said madeleine wrinkled up her nose are you going to keep doing that no leonard said i don t even know why i do it it s just something i picked up from my rodeo days at the next trash can they came to he tossed the coke and spat out his wad of tobacco within a few blocks pretty campus plantings of tulip and daffodil gave way to treeless streets lined by working class houses painted in cheerful hues they passed a portuguese bakery and a portuguese fish store selling sardines and cuttlefish the kids here had no yards to play in but seemed happy enough wheeling back and forth along the blank sidewalks nearer the highway there were a few warehouses and on the corner of wickenden a local diner leonard wanted to sit at the counter i need to be close to the pies he said i need to see which one is talking to me as madeleine took a stool next to him leonard stared at the dessert case do you remember when they used to serve slices of cheese with apple pie he asked vaguely madeleine said they don t seem to do that anymore you and i are probably the only two people in this place who remember it actually i don t remember it madeleine said you don t never had a little slice of wisconsin cheddar with your apple pie i m sorry to hear that maybe they ll put a slice of cheese on a piece if you ask them i didn t say i liked it i m just mourning its passage the conversation lapsed and suddenly to her surprise madeleine was flooded with panic she felt the silence like a judgment against her at the same time her anxiety about the silence made it even harder to speak though it didn t feel nice to be so nervous it did feel nice in a way it had been a while since madeleine had been that way around a guy the waitress was down at the end of the counter talking to another customer so why are you taking zipperstein s class she asked philosophical interest leonard said literally philosophy s all about theory of language right now it s all linguistics so i figured i d check it out aren t you a biology major too that s what i really am leonard said the philosophy s just a sideline madeleine realized that she d never dated a science major do you want to be a doctor right now all i want to do is get the waitress s attention leonard waved his arm a few times to no avail suddenly he said is it hot in here without waiting for an answer he reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a blue bandanna which he proceeded to put over his head tying it in back and making a number of small precise adjustments until he was satisfied madeleine watched this with a slight feeling of disappointment she associated bandannas with hacky sack the grateful dead and alfalfa sprouts all of which she could do without still she was impressed with leonard s sheer size on the stool next to her his largeness coupled with the softness the delicacy almost of his voice gave madeleine a strange fairytale feeling as if she were a princess sitting beside a gentle giant the thing is though leonard said still staring in the waitress s direction i didn t get interested in philosophy because of linguistics i got interested for the eternal verities to learn how to die et cetera now it s more like what do we mean when we say we die what do we mean we mean when we say we die finally the waitress came over madeleine ordered the cottage cheese plate and coffee leonard ordered apple pie and coffee when the waitress left he spun his stool rightward so that their knees briefly touched how very female of you he said sorry cottage cheese i like cottage cheese are you on a diet you don t look like someone on a diet why do you want to know madeleine said and here for the first time leonard appeared rattled beneath the line of the bandanna his face colored and he spun away breaking eye contact just curious he said in the next second he spun back resuming the previous conversation derrida s supposed to be a lot clearer in french he said rumor has it his prose in french is limpid maybe i should read it in french then you know french leonard said sounding impressed i m not great i can read flaubert it was then that madeleine made a big mistake things were going so well with leonard the mood was so promising even the weather lending a hand because after they finished their food and left the diner walking back to campus a march drizzle forced them to share madeleine s collapsible umbrella that a feeling came over her like those she d had as a girl when treated to a pastry or a dessert a happiness so fraught by an awareness of its brevity that she took the tiniest bites making the cream puff or éclair last as long as possible in this same way instead of seeing where the afternoon led madeleine decided to check its progress to save some for later and she told leonard she had to go home and study they didn t kiss goodbye they didn t come close to it leonard hunching under the umbrella abruptly said bye and hurried off through the rain keeping his head down madeleine went back to the narragansett she lay down on her bed and didn t move for a long time the days dragged until the next meeting of sem 211 madeleine arrived early choosing a seat at the seminar table next to leonard s usual spot but when he showed up ten minutes late he took an available chair next to the professor he didn t say anything in class or glance in madeleine s direction even once his face looked swollen and there was a line of blemishes running down one cheek when the class ended leonard was the first one out the door the next week he missed class entirely and so madeleine was left to contend with semiotics and with zipperstein and his disciples all by herself by now they had moved on to derrida s of grammatology the derrida went like this in that sense it is the aufhebung of other writings particularly of hieroglyphic script and of the leibnizian characteristic that had been criticized previously through one and the same gesture in poetic moods the derrida went like this what writing itself in its nonphonetic moment betrays is life it menaces at once the breath the spirit and history as the spirit s relationship with itself it is their end their finitude their paralysis since derrida claimed that language by its very nature undermined any meaning it attempted to promote madeleine wondered how derrida expected her to get his meaning maybe he didn t that was why he deployed so much arcane terminology so many loop de looping clauses that was why he said what he said in sentences it took a minute to identify the subjects of could the access to pluridimensionality and to a delinearized temporality really be a subject reading a novel after reading semiotic theory was like jogging empty handed after jogging with hand weights after getting out of semiotics 211 madeleine fled to the rockefeller library down to b level where the stacks exuded a vivifying smell of mold and grabbed something anything the house of mirth daniel deronda to restore herself to sanity how wonderful it was when one sentence followed logically from the sentence before what exquisite guilt she felt wickedly enjoying narrative madeleine felt safe with a nineteenth century novel there were going to be people in it something was going to happen to them in a place resembling the world then too there were lots of weddings in wharton and austen there were all kinds of irresistible gloomy men the next thursday madeleine came to class wearing a norwegian sweater with a snowflake design she d gone back to her glasses for the second week in a row leonard didn t show up madeleine worried that he d dropped the class but it was too late in the semester to do that zipperstein said has anybody seen mr bankhead is he sick nobody knew thurston arrived with a girl named cassandra hart both of them sniffly and heroin pale taking out a black flair pen thurston wrote on cassandra s bare shoulder not real skin zipperstein was in a lively mood he d just returned from a conference in new york dressed differently than usual listening to him talk about the paper he d given at the new school madeleine suddenly understood semiotics was the form zipperstein s midlife crisis had taken becoming a semiotician allowed zipperstein to wear a leather jacket to fly off to douglas sirk retrospectives in vancouver and to get all the sexy waifs in his classes instead of leaving his wife zipperstein had left the english department instead of buying a sports car he d bought deconstruction he sat at the seminar table now and started speaking i hope you read the semiotext e for this week apropos of lyotard and in homage to gertrude stein let me suggest the following the thing about desire is that there is no there there that was it that was zipperstein s prompt he sat before them blinking waiting for somebody to reply he appeared to have all the patience in the world madeleine had wanted to know what semiotics was she d wanted to know what the fuss was about well now she felt she knew but then in week ten for reasons that were entirely extracurricular semiotics began making sense it was a friday night in april just past eleven and madeleine was in bed reading the assigned text for that week was roland barthes a lover s discourse for a book purportedly about love it didn t look very romantic the cover was a somber chocolate brown the title turquoise there was no author photograph and only a sketchy bio listing barthes other works madeleine had the book in her lap with her right hand she was eating peanut butter straight from the jar the spoon fit perfectly against the curve of her upper palate allowing the peanut butter to dissolve creamily against her tongue opening to the introduction she began to read the necessity for this book is to be found in the following consideration that the lover s discourse is today of an extreme solitude outside the temperature which had remained cold through march had shot up into the fifties the resulting thaw was alarming in its suddenness drainpipes and gutters dripping sidewalks puddling streets flooded a constant sound of water rushing downhill madeleine had her windows open on the liquid darkness she sucked the spoon and read on what we have been able to say below about waiting anxiety memory is no more than a modest supplement offered to the reader to be made free with to be added to subtracted from and passed on to others around the figure the players pass the handkerchief which sometimes by a final parenthesis is held a second longer before handing it on ideally the book would be a cooperative to the united readers and lovers it wasn t only that this writing seemed beautiful to madeleine it wasn t only that these opening sentences of barthes made immediate sense it wasn t only the relief at recognizing that here finally was a book she might write her final paper on what made madeleine sit up in bed was something closer to the reason she read books in the first place and had always loved them here was a sign that she wasn t alone here was an articulation of what she had been so far mutely feeling in bed on a friday night wearing sweatpants her hair tied back her glasses smudged and eating peanut butter from the jar madeleine was in a state of extreme solitude it had to do with leonard with how she felt about him and how she couldn t tell anyone with how much she liked him and how little she knew about him with how desperately she wanted to see him and how hard it was to do so in recent days from her solitude madeleine had sent out feelers she talked about semiotics 211 with her roommates mentioning thurston cassandra and leonard it turned out that abby knew leonard from her freshman year what was he like madeleine asked sort of intense really smart but intense he used to call me all the time like every day did he like you no he just wanted to talk he d keep me on the phone for an hour what did you guys talk about everything his relationship my relationship his parents my parents jimmy carter getting attacked by that swamp rabbit which he was obsessed about he d go on and on who was he going out with some girl named mindy but then they broke up that s when he really started calling me he d call like six times a day he was always going on about how good mindy smelled she had this smell that was supposedly perfectly compatible to leonard chemically he was worried no girl would ever smell right to him again i told him it was probably her moisturizer he said no it was her skin it was chemically perfect that s what he s like she paused and gave madeleine a searching look why are you asking do you like him i just know him from class madeleine said do you want me to invite him for dinner i didn t say that i ll invite him to dinner abby said the dinner had been on tuesday night three days ago leonard had come politely bearing a gift a set of dish towels he d dressed up wearing a white shirt with a skinny necktie his long hair gathered in a masculine ponytail like a scottish warrior he was touchingly sincere saying hello to abby handing her the wrapped gift and thanking her for the invitation madeleine tried not to seem overeager at dinner she paid attention to brian weeger whose breath had a dog food smell a couple of times when she looked over at leonard he stared back fixedly appearing almost upset later when madeleine was in the kitchen rinsing dishes leonard came in she turned to find him inspecting a bump on the wall this must be an old gas main he said madeleine looked at the bump which had been painted over many times they used to have gas lamps in these old places leonard went on they probably used to pump the gas up from the basement if anybody s pilot blew out on any floor you d have a leak gas didn t have an odor back then either they didn t start adding methyl mercaptan until later good to know madeleine said this place must have been a powder keg leonard tapped the jutting object with his fingernail turned and looked madeleine meaningfully in the face i haven t been going to class he said i know leonard s head was way up above her but then he bent down in a peaceful leaf eater motion and said i haven t been feeling well were you sick i m better now in the living room olivia called out who wants some delamain it s yummy i want some brian weeger said that stuff s killer leonard said were the dish towels all right what the dish towels i bought you some dish towels oh they re great madeleine said they re perfect we ll use them thank you i would have brought wine or scotch but that s the kind of thing my father would do you don t want to do anything your father would do leonard s face and voice remained solemn as he replied my father is a depressive who self medicates with alcohol my mother is more or less the same where do they live they re divorced my mother still lives in portland where i m from my dad s in europe he lives in antwerp last time i heard this interchange was encouraging in a way leonard was sharing personal information on the other hand the information indicated that he had a troubled relationship with his parents who were themselves troubled and madeleine made a point of going out only with guys who liked their parents what does your father do leonard asked caught off guard madeleine hesitated he used to work at a college she said he s retired what was he professor he was the president leonard s face twitched oh it s just a small college in new jersey it s called baxter abby came in to get some glasses leonard helped her get them off the top shelf when she was gone he turned back to madeleine and said as if in pain there s a fellini film playing at the cable car this weekend amarcord madeleine gazed encouragingly up at him there were all kinds of outmoded novelistic words to describe how she was feeling words like aflutter but she had her rules one rule was that the guy had to ask her out not the other way around i think it s playing on saturday leonard said this saturday do you like fellini to reply to this question did not in madeleine s view compromise her rule you want to know something embarrassing she said i ve never seen a fellini film you should see one leonard said i ll call you all right do i have your number oh right i have it it s the same as abby s number do you want me to write it down madeleine asked no leonard said i have it and he rose brontosaurus like to his place among the treetops for the rest of the week madeleine stayed in every night waiting for leonard to call when she came back from classes in the afternoon she interrogated her roommates to find out if he had called while she was out some guy called yesterday olivia said on thursday when i was in the shower why didn t you tell me sorry i forgot who was it he didn t say did it sound like leonard i didn t notice i was dripping wet thanks for taking a message sorree olivia said god it was just a two second call he said he d call back later and so now it was friday night friday night and madeleine had declined to go out with abby and olivia in order to stay in and wait by the phone she was reading a lover s discourse and marveling at its relevance to her life waiting attente waiting tumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being subject to trivial delays rendezvous letters telephone calls returns waiting is an enchantment i have received orders not to move waiting for a telephone is thereby woven out of tiny unavowable interdictions to infinity i forbid myself to leave the room to go to the toilet even to telephone to keep the line from being busy she could hear the television going in the apartment below madeleine s bedroom faced the state capitol dome brightly lit against the dark sky the heat which they couldn t control was still on the radiator wastefully knocking and hissing the more she thought about it the more madeleine understood that extreme solitude didn t just describe the way she was feeling about leonard it explained how she d always felt when she was in love it explained what love was like and just maybe what was wrong with it the telephone rang madeleine sat up in bed she dog eared the page she was reading she waited as long as she could three rings before answering hello maddy it was alton calling from prettybrook oh hi daddy don t sound so excited i m studying in his usual way without niceties he got to the matter at hand your mother and i were just discussing graduation plans for a moment madeleine thought alton meant that they were discussing her future but then she realized it was just logistics it s april she said graduation s not until june my experience with college towns is that the hotels get booked up months in advance so we have to decide what we re doing now here are the options are you listening yes madeleine said and began at that instant to tune out she stuck the spoon back into the peanut butter jar and brought it to her mouth this time just licking it in the phone alton s voice was saying option one your mother and i come up the night before the ceremony stay in a hotel and we see you for dinner the night of graduation option two we come up the morning of the ceremony have breakfast with you and then leave after the ceremony both proposals are acceptable to us it s your choice but let me explain the pros and cons of each scenario madeleine was about to answer when phyllida spoke up on another extension hi dear i hope we didn t wake you we didn t wake her alton barked eleven o clock s not late at college especially on a friday night hey what are you doing in on a friday night got a pimple hi mummy madeleine said ignoring him maddy sweetie we re redoing your bedroom and i wanted to ask you you re redoing my bedroom yes it needs freshening up i my room yes i was thinking about recarpeting it in green you know a good green no madeleine cried maddy we ve kept your room the way it is for four years now you d think it was a shrine i d like to be able to use it as a guest room occasionally because of the en suite bathroom you can still have it when you come home don t worry it ll always be your room what about my wallpaper it s old it s peeling you can t change my wallpaper oh all right i ll leave the wallpaper alone but the carpet excuse me alton said in a peremptory tone this call is about graduation phyl you re hijacking my agenda you two sort out the redecorating some other time now maddy let me go over the pros and cons when your cousin graduated from williams we all had dinner after the ceremony and if you ll remember doats complained the whole time that he was missing all the parties and he left halfway through the meal now your mother and i are willing to stay the night or two nights if we re going to see you but if you re going to be busy maybe the breakfast option makes more sense graduation s two months away i don t even know what s happening yet that s what i told your father phyllida said it occurred to madeleine that she was tying up the line let me think about it she said abruptly i have to go i m studying if we re going to stay the night alton repeated i d like to make reservations soon call me later let me think about it call me sunday alton was still speaking when she hung up so when the phone rang again twenty seconds later madeleine picked up and said daddy stop it we don t have to decide tonight there was silence on the line and then a male voice said you don t have to call me daddy oh god leonard sorry i thought you were my father he s freaking out about graduation plans already i was just having a little freak out myself about what about calling you this was good madeleine ran a finger along her lower lip she said have you calmed down or do you want to call back later i m resting comfortably now thank you madeleine waited for more none came are you calling for a reason she asked yes that fellini film i was hoping you might if you re not too i know it s bad manners calling so late but i was at the lab leonard did sound a little nervous that wasn t good madeleine didn t like nervous guys nervous guys were nervous for a reason up until now leonard had seemed more the tortured type than the nervous type tortured was better i don t think that was a complete sentence she said what did i leave out leonard asked how about would you like to come with me i d be happy to leonard said madeleine frowned into the receiver she had a feeling that leonard had set up this exchange like a chess player thinking eight moves ahead she was going to complain when leonard said sorry not funny he comically cleared his throat listen would you like to go to the movies with me she didn t answer right away he deserved a little punishment and so she put the screws to him for another three seconds i d love to and there it was already that word she wondered if leonard had noticed she wondered what it meant that she had noticed it was just a word after all a way of speaking the next night saturday the fickle weather turned cold again madeleine was chilled in her brown suede jacket as she walked to the restaurant where they d agreed to meet afterward they made their way to the cable car and found a sagging couch among the other mismatched sofas and armchairs that furnished the art house cinema she had a hard time following the movie the narrative cues weren t as crisp as those of hollywood and the film had a dream like quality lush but discontinuous the audience being a college audience laughed knowingly during the risqué european moments when the huge titted woman stuffed her huge tit into the young hero s mouth or when the old man up in the tree cried out i want a woman fellini s theme appeared to be the same as roland barthes love but here it was italian and all about the body instead of french and all about the mind she wondered if leonard had known what amarcord was going to be about she wondered if it was his way of getting her in the mood as it so happened she was in the mood but no thanks to the movie the movie was pretty to look at but confused her and made her feel naïve and suburban it seemed both overly indulgent and overly male after it was over they made their way out onto south main they had no stated destination madeleine was pleased to realize that leonard though tall wasn t too tall if she wore heels the top of her head came up higher than his shoulders almost to his chin what did you think he said well at least now i know what felliniesque is the downtown skyline was on their left across the river the spire of the superman building visible against the unnaturally pink city sky the streets were empty except for other people leaving the cinema my goal in life is to become an adjective leonard said people would go around saying that was so bankheadian or a little too bankheadian for my taste bankheadian has a ring madeleine said it s better than bankheadesque or bankheadish ish is terrible all around there s joycean shakespearean faulknerian but ish who is there who s an ish thomas mannish kafkaesque leonard said pynchonesque see pynchon s already an adjective gaddis what would gaddis be gaddisesque gaddisy you can t really do it with gaddis madeleine said yeah leonard said tough luck for gaddis do you like him i read a little of the recognitions madeleine said they turned up planet street climbing the slope bellovian leonard said it s extra nice when they change the spelling slightly nabokovian already has the v so does chekhovian the russians have it made tolstoyan that guy was an adjective waiting to happen don t forget tolstoyanism madeleine said my god leonard said a noun i ve never even dreamed of being a noun what would bankheadian mean leonard thought for a second of or related to leonard bankhead american born 1959 characterized by excessive introspection or worry gloomy depressive see basket case madeleine was laughing leonard stopped walking and took hold of her arm looking at her seriously i m taking you to my place he said what all this time we ve been walking i ve been leading you back to my place this is how i do it apparently it s shameful shameful i don t want it to be like that not with you so i m telling you i figured we were going back to your place you did i was going to call you on it when we got closer we re already close i can t come up please no not tonight hannaesque leonard said stubborn given to ironclad positions hannarian madeleine said dangerous not to be messed with i stand warned they stood looking at each other on cold dark planet street leonard took his hands out of his pockets to tuck his long hair behind his ears maybe i ll come up just for a minute madeleine said special days fête festivity the amorous subject experiences every meeting with the loved being as a festival 1 the festivity is what is waited for what is expected what i expect of the promised presence is an unheard of totality of pleasures a banquet i rejoice like the child laughing at the sight of the mother whose mere presence heralds and signifies a plenitude of satisfactions i am about to have before me and for myself the source of all good things i am living through days as happy as those god keeps for his chosen people and whatever becomes of me i can never say that i have not tasted the purest joys of life it was debatable whether or not madeleine had fallen in love with leonard the first moment she d seen him she hadn t even known him then and so what she d felt was only sexual attraction not love even after they d gone out for coffee she couldn t say that what she was feeling was anything more than infatuation but ever since the night when they went back to leonard s place after watching amarcordand started fooling around when madeleine found that instead of being turned off by physical stuff the way she often was with boys instead of putting up with that or trying to overlook it she d spent the entire night worrying that she was turning leonard off worrying that her body wasn t good enough or that her breath was bad from the caesar salad she d unwisely ordered at dinner worrying too about having suggested they order martinis because of the way leonard had sarcastically said sure martinis we can pretend we re salinger characters after having had as a consequence of all this anxiety pretty much no sexual pleasure despite the perfectly respectable session they d put together and after leonard like every guy had immediately fallen asleep leaving her to lie awake stroking his head and vaguely hoping she didn t get a urinary tract infection madeleine asked herself if the fact that she d just spent the whole night worrying wasn t in fact a surefire sign that she was falling in love and certainly after they d spent the next three days at leonard s place having sex and eating pizza after she d relaxed enough to be able to come at least once in a while and finally to stop worrying so much about having an orgasm because her hunger for leonard was in some way satisfied by his satisfaction after she d allowed herself to sit naked on his gross couch and to walk to the bathroom knowing he was staring at her imperfect ass to root for food in his disgusting refrigerator to read the brilliant half page of philosophy paper sticking up out of his typewriter and to hear him pee with taurine force into the toilet bowl certainly by the end of those three days madeleine knew she was in love but that didn t mean she had to tell anyone especially leonard leonard bankhead had a studio apartment on the third floor of a low rent student building the halls were full of bikes and junk mail stickers decorated the other tenants doors a fluorescent marijuana leaf a silk screen blondie leonard s door however was as blank as the apartment inside in the middle of the room a twin mattress lay beside a plastic milk crate supporting a reading lamp there was no desk no bookcase not even a table only the nasty couch with a typewriter on another milk crate in front of it there was nothing on the walls but bits of masking tape and in one corner a small portrait of leonard done in pencil the drawing showed leonard as george washington wearing a tricorne hat and sheltering under a blanket at valley forge the caption read you go i like it here madeleine thought the handwriting looked feminine a ficus tree endured in the corner leonard moved it into the sun whenever he remembered to madeleine taking pity on the tree began to water it until she caught leonard looking at her one day his eyes narrowed with suspicion what she said nothing come on what you re watering my tree the soil s dry you re taking care of my tree she stopped doing it after that there was a tiny kitchen where leonard brewed and reheated the gallon of coffee he drank every day a big greasy wok sat on the stove the most leonard did in the way of preparing a meal however was to pour grape nuts into the wok with raisins raisins satisfied his fruit requirement the apartment had a message the message said i am an orphan abby and olivia asked madeleine what she and leonard did together and she never had an answer they didn t do i anything she came to his apartment and they lay down on the mattress and leonard asked her how she was doing really wanting to know what did they do she talked he listened then he talked and she listened she d never met anyone and certainly not a guy who was so receptive who took everything in she guessed that leonard s shrink like manner came from years of seeing shrinks himself and though another of her rules was to never date guys who went to shrinks madeleine began to reconsider this prohibition back home she and her sister had a phrase for serious emotional talks they called it having a heavy if a boy approached during one the girls would look up and give warning we re having a heavy and the boy would retreat until it was over until the heavy had passed going out with leonard was like having a heavy all the time whenever she was with him leonard gave her his full attention he didn t stare into her eyes or smother her the way billy had but he made it clear he was available he offered little advice only listened and murmured reassuringly people often fell in love with their shrinks didn t they that was called transference and was to be avoided but what if you were already sleeping with your shrink what if your shrink s couch was already a bed and plus it wasn t all heavy the heavies leonard was funny he told hilarious stories in a deadpan voice his head sank into his shoulders his eyes filled with rue as his sentences drawled on did i ever tell you i play an instrument the summer my parents got divorced they sent me to live with my grandparents in buffalo the people next door were latvian the bruverises and they both played the kokle do you know what a kokle is it s sort of like a zither but latvian anyway i used to hear mr and mrs bruveris playing their kokles over in the next yard it was an amazing sound sort of wild and over stimulated on the one hand but melancholy on the other the kokle is the manic depressive of the string family anyway i was bored to death that summer i was sixteen six foot one one hundred and thirty eight pounds a major reefer smoker i used to get high in my bedroom and blow the smoke out the window and then i d go out to the porch and listen to the bruverises playing next door sometimes other people came over other kokle players they set up lawn chairs in the backyard and they d all sit there playing together it was an orchestra a kokle orchestra then one day they saw me watching and invited me over they gave me potato salad and a grape popsicle and i asked mr bruveris how you played a kokle and he started giving me lessons i used to go over there every day they had an old kokle they let me borrow i used to practice five six hours a day i was into it at the end of that summer when i had to leave the bruverises gave me the kokle to keep i took it on the plane with me i got a separate seat for it like i was rostropovich my father had moved out of the house by then so it was just me my sister and my mother and i kept on practicing i got good enough that i joined this band we used to play at ethnic festivals and orthodox weddings we had these traditional costumes embroidered vests puffy sleeves knee high boots me and all the adults most of them were latvian some russians too our big number was otchi tchornyia that s the only thing that saved me in high school the kokle do you still play hell no are you kidding the kokle listening to leonard madeleine felt impoverished by her happy childhood she never wondered why she acted the way she did or what effect her parents had had on her personality being fortunate had dulled her powers of observation whereas leonard noticed every little thing for instance they spent a weekend on cape cod partly to visit pilgrim lake laboratory where leonard was applying for a research fellowship and as they were driving back leonard said what do you do just hold it what you just hold it for two days until you get back home as his meaning seeped in she said i can t believe you you have never ever taken a dump in my presence in your presence when i am present or nearby what s wrong with that what s wrong with it nothing if you re talking about i sleep over and go off to class the next morning and then you go and take a dump that s understandable but when we spend two almost three days together eating surf and turf and you do not take a dump the entire time i can only conclude that you are more than a little anal so what it s embarrassing madeleine said o k i find it embarrassing leonard stared at her without expression and said do you mind when i take a dump do we have to talk about this it s sort of gross i think we do need to talk about it because you re obviously not very relaxed around me and i am or thought i was your boyfriend and that means or should mean that i m the person you re most relaxed around leonard equals maximum relaxation guys weren t supposed to be the talkers guys weren t supposed to get you to open up but this guy was this guy did he d said he was her boyfriend too he d made it official i ll try to be more relaxed madeleine said if it ll make you happy but in terms of excretion don t get your hopes up this isn t for me leonard said this is for mr lower intestine this is for mr duodenum even though this kind of amateur therapy didn t exactly work after that last conversation for instance madeleine had more not less trouble going number 2 if leonard was within a mile it affected madeleine deeply leonard was examining her closely she felt handled in the right way like something precious or immensely fascinating it made her happy to think about how much he thought about her by the end of april madeleine and leonard had gotten into a routine of spending every night together on weeknights after madeleine finished studying she headed over to the biology lab where she d find leonard staring at slides with two chinese grad students after she finally got leonard to leave the lab madeleine then had to cajole him into sleeping at her place at first leonard had liked staying at the narragansett he liked the ornate moldings and the view from her bedroom he charmed olivia and abby by making pancakes on sunday mornings but soon leonard began to complain that they always stayed at madeleine s place and that he never got to wake up in his own bed staying at leonard s place however required madeleine to bring a fresh set of clothes each night and since he didn t like her to leave clothes at his place and to be honest she didn t like to either because whatever she left picked up a fusty smell madeleine had to carry her dirty clothes around to classes all day she preferred sleeping at her own apartment where she could use her own shampoo conditioner and loofah and where it was clean sheet day every wednesday leonard never changed his sheets they were a disturbing gray color dust balls clung to the edges of the mattress one morning madeleine was horrified to see a calligraphic smear of blood that had leaked from her three weeks earlier a stain she d attacked with a kitchen sponge while leonard was sleeping you never wash your sheets she complained i wash them leonard said evenly how often when they get dirty they re always dirty not everyone can drop off their laundry at the cleaners every week not everybody grew up with clean sheet day you don t have to drop them off madeleine said undeterred you ve got a washer in the basement i use the washer leonard said just not every wednesday i don t equate dirt with death and decay oh and i do i m obsessed with death because i wash my sheets people s attitudes to cleanliness have a lot to do with their fear of death this isn t about death leonard this is about crumbs in the bed this is about the fact that your pillow smells like a liverwurst sandwich wrong it does wrong smell it leonard it s salami i don t like liverwurst to a certain extent this kind of arguing was fun but then came nights when madeleine forgot to pack a change of clothes and leonard accused her of doing this on purpose in order to force him to sleep at her place next more worryingly came nights when leonard said he was going home to study and would see her tomorrow he began pulling all nighters one of his philosophy professors offered leonard the use of his cabin in the berkshires and for an entire rainy weekend leonard went there alone to write a paper on fichte returning with a typescript 123 pages long and wearing a bright orange hunter s vest the vest became his favorite item of clothing he wore it all the time he started finishing madeleine s sentences as if her mind was too slow as if he couldn t wait for her to gather her thoughts he riffed on the things she said going off on strange tangents making puns whenever she told him he needed to get some sleep he got angry and didn t call her for days and it was during this period that madeleine fully understood how the lover s discourse was of an extreme solitude the solitude was extreme because it wasn t physical it was extreme because you felt it while in the company of the person you loved it was extreme because it was in your head that most solitary of places the more leonard pulled away the more anxious madeleine became the more desperate she became the more leonard pulled away she told herself to act cool she went to the library to work on her marriage plot thesis but the sex fantasy atmosphere the reading room eye contact the beckoning stacks made her desperate to see leonard and so against her will her feet began leading her back across campus through the darkness to the biology department up to the last moment madeleine had the crazy hope that this expression of weakness might in fact be strength it was a brilliant strategy because it lacked all strategy it involved no games only sincerity seeing such sincerity how could leonard fail to respond she was almost happy as she came up behind the lab table and tapped leonard on the shoulder and her happiness lasted until he turned around with a look not of love but of annoyance it didn t help that it was spring every day people seemed more and more unclothed the magnolia trees budding on the green looked positively enflamed they sent out a perfume that drifted through the windows of semiotics 211 the magnolia trees hadn t read roland barthes they didn t think love was a mental state the magnolias insisted it was natural perennial on a beautiful warm may day madeleine showered shaved her legs with extra care and put on her first spring dress an apple green baby doll dress with a bib collar and a high hem with this she wore buster browns cream and rust and went sockless her bare legs toned from a winter of squash playing were pale but smooth she kept her glasses on left her hair loose and walked over to leonard s apartment on planet street on the way she stopped at a market to buy a hunk of cheese some stoned wheat thins and a bottle of valpolicella coming down the hill from benefit toward south main she felt the warm breeze between her thighs the front door of leonard s building was propped open with a brick so she went up to his apartment and knocked leonard opened the door he looked like he d been napping niiiiice dress he said they never made it to the park they picnicked on each other as leonard pulled her toward the mattress madeleine dropped her packages hoping the wine bottle didn t break she slipped her dress over her head soon they were naked raiding it felt like a huge basket of goodies madeleine lay on her stomach her side her back nibbling all the treats the nice smelling fruit candies the meaty drumsticks as well as more sophisticated offerings the biscotti flavored with anise the wrinkly truffles the salty spoonfuls of olive tapenade she d never been so busy in her life at the same time she felt strangely displaced not quite her usual tidy ego but merged with leonard into a great big protoplasmic ecstatic thing she thought she d been in love before she knew she d had sex before but all those torrid adolescent gropings all those awkward backseat romps the meaningful performative summer nights with her high school boyfriend jim mcmanus even the tender sessions with billy where he insisted they look into each other s eyes as they came none of that prepared her for the wallop the all consuming pleasure of this leonard was kissing her when she could bear no more madeleine grabbed him savagely by his ears she pulled leonard s head away and held it still to show him the evidence of how she felt she was crying now in a hoarse voice edged with something else a sense of peril madeleine said i love you leonard stared back at her his eyebrows twitched suddenly he rolled sideways off the mattress he stood up and walked naked across the room crouching he reached into her bag and pulled out a lover s discourse from the pocket where she always kept it he flipped the pages until he found the one he wanted then he returned to the bed and handed the book to her i love you je t aime i love you as she read these words madeleine was flooded with happiness she glanced up at leonard smiling with his finger he motioned for her to keep going the figure refers not to the declaration of love to the avowal but to the repeated utterance of the love cry i suddenly madeleine s happiness diminished usurped by the feeling of peril she wished she weren t naked she narrowed her shoulders and covered herself with the bedsheet as she obediently read on once the first avowal has been made i love you has no meaning whatever leonard squatting had a smirk on his face it was then that madeleine threw the book at his head,en
