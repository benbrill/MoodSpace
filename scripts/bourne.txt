186 INT. KITCHENETTE -- BERLIN HQ/COMMAND POST -- DAY 186

NICKY is joined by PAMELA who goes for the coffee.

PAMELA
Is it fresh?

NICKY
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I
know.

Before PAMELA can pour, her cell phone rings. She *
answers. *

PAMELA
Pamela Landy.

BOURNE/PHONE
I was at the Westin this morning. I could *
have killed you. *

PAMELA
Who is this?

INTERCUT WITH ROOFTOP

BOURNE *
It's me. *

PAMELA
(Holy Christ)
Bourne?

62.


NICKY reacts to the name. Runs to the other room to try
and start a trace.

PAMELA (cont'd) (CONT'D)
What do you want?

BOURNE
I want to come in.

He wants to come in! -- it's like a bomb going off -- NICKY
back in with Conklin -- PAMELA waving for a pencil.

PAMELA
Okay, how do you want to do it? *

BOURNE
I want someone I know to take me in. *

PAMELA
Who?

BOURNE
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the
program. She used to handle the
medication.

AND NOW WE STAY WITH

PAMELA -- her eyes flicker over to NICKY.

PAMELA
What if we can't find her?

BOURNE/PHONE
It's easy. She's standing right in front
of you.

Busted. *

PAMELA *
Okay, Jason, your move. *

BOURNE *
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the *
World Clock. Alone. Give her your *
phone. *

Click. The line goes dead -- Pamela steps away from the *
window, realizing he's on one of the roofs out there! *
