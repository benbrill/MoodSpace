NICKY is joined by PAMELA who goes for the coffee.

PAMELA
Is it fresh?

NICKY
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I
know.

Before PAMELA can pour, her cell phone rings. She 
answers. 

PAMELA
Pamela Landy.

BOURNE/PHONE
I was at the Westin this morning. I could 
have killed you. 

PAMELA
Who is this?

INTERCUT WITH ROOFTOP

BOURNE 
It's me. 

PAMELA
(Holy Christ)
Bourne?


NICKY reacts to the name. Runs to the other room to try
and start a trace.

PAMELA  
What do you want?

BOURNE
I want to come in.

He wants to come in! -- it's like a bomb going off -- NICKY
back in with Conklin -- PAMELA waving for a pencil.

PAMELA
Okay, how do you want to do it? 

BOURNE
I want someone I know to take me in. 

PAMELA
Who?

BOURNE
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the
program. She used to handle the
medication.

AND NOW WE STAY WITH

PAMELA -- her eyes flicker over to NICKY.

PAMELA
What if we can't find her?

BOURNE/PHONE
It's easy. She's standing right in front
of you.

Busted. 

PAMELA 
Okay, Jason, your move. 

Click. The line goes dead -- Pamela steps away from the
window, realizing he's on one of the roofs out there!
