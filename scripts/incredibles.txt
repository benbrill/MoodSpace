- [on TV] The ship's unique design suggests...

- [on TV] There were no fatalities...



SYNDROME

Huh? Huh? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool. Just
like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically, do some damage. Throngs of
screaming people! And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day!
I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

You mean you killed off real heroes so that you could
pretend to be one?



SYNDROME

Oh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat you! And I did it
without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers. I'll give them heroics.
I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen! And when I'm
old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be
superheroes. Everyone can be super. And when everyone's super...no one will be.
