                   Horror from all. Kirk picks up a phaser. As the eel
                   clears Chekov, he fires and destroys it. He shudders,
                   then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it.

                                           KIRK
                             Khan, you bloodsucker, they're
                             finished! You'll have to do your
                             own dirty work now. Do you hear me?
                             Do you?
                                     

                   Khan reacts to Kirk's VOICE: electronic shock. He
                   clutches the communicator, his eye-whites rolling.

                                           KHAN
                             Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive --
                             my old friend...

                   INTERCUT AS DESIRED WITH

                                           KIRK
                             Still, 'old friend.' You've
                             managed to kill just about everyone
                             else, but like a poor marksman, you
                             keep missing the target.

                                           KHAN
                                     ironic
                             Perhaps I no longer need to try.

                   He punches several buttons.

                   In the Rocky Cavern the transporter beam locks on to the
                   Genesis torpedo and its arming control box.

                   As Kirk and the others watch, horrified, Khan beams up
                   the materials. David tries to reach the torpedo, but
                   Saavik holds him fast --

                                           DAVID
                             Let go -- he can't -- !

                                           SAAVIK
                             Only half of you would get there.

                   The beam disappears and Genesis with it, leaving them
                   alone.

                                           KIRK
                                     desperate
                             Khan, you have Genesis, but you
                             don't have me! You were going to
                             kill me, Khan, it was your sole
                             purpose. You'll have to come down
                             here to do it! You'll have to
                             come down!

                                           KHAN'S VOICE
                             I've done far worse than kill you,
                             Admiral. I've hurt you. And I
                             wish to go on hurting you. I
                             shall leave you, as you left me --
                             where no one will ever find you:
                             poetic justice; marooned for
                             eternity in the center of a dead
                             planet -- buried alive.

                                           KIRK
                             Khan -- !

                                           KHAN
                             Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't
                             count on Enterprise. She can't
                             move. My next act will be to blow
                             her out of the heavens.

                                           KIRK
                             KHAN!
