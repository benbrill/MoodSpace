A bus pulls up. Forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus 
               continues on.

               A BLACK WOMAN in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at 
               the bus bench next to Forrest. The nurse begins to read a 
               magazine as Forrest looks at her.

                         Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.

               He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse.

                         You want a chocolate?

               The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this 
               strange man next to her.

                         I could eat about a million and a 
                         half of these. My momma always said, 
                         "Life was like a box of chocolates.
                         You never know what you're gonna 
                         get."

               Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's 
               shoes.

                                     FORREST
                         Those must be comfortable shoes. 
                         I'll bet you could walk all day in 
                         shoes like that and not feel a thing. 
                         I wish I had shoes like that.

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                         My feet hurt.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma always says there's an awful 
                         lot you could tell about a person by 
                         their shoes. Where they're going.
                         Where they've been.

               The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his 
               own shoes.

                                     FORREST
                         I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I 
                         think about it real hard I could 
                         remember my first pair of shoes.

               Forrest closes his eyes tightly.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma said they'd take my anywhere.
